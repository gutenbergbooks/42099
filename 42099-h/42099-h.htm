<p>fter all the tragic adventures
which Frank Nelson had passed
through, since entering the service
of his country, which we have attempted
to describe in the preceding
volume of this series, he found himself
surrounded by his relatives and
friends, petted and fêted, enjoying all the comforts
of his old and well-beloved home.</p>

<p>Only those who have been in similar circumstances
can imagine how pleasant that quiet little
cottage seemed to Frank, after the scenes of danger
through which he had passed. He looked
back to the memorable struggle between the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
lines; the scene in the turret during the first
day's fight at Fort Pemberton; the privations he
had undergone while confined in the prison at
Shreveport; his almost miraculous escape; and
they seemed to him like a dream. All his sufferings
were forgotten in the joy he felt at finding
himself once more at home. But sorrow was
mingled with his joy when he looked upon the
weeds which his mother wore, and when he saw
the look of sadness which had taken the place of
her once happy smile. She seemed ten years
older than she looked on that pleasant morning,
just fifteen months before, when, standing in
the door, she had strained her son to her bosom,
and uttered those words which had rung in
Frank's ears whenever he felt himself about to
give away to his feelings of terror:</p>

<p>"Good-by, my son; I may never see you again,
but I hope I shall never hear that you shrank
from your duty."</p>

<p>Frank shuddered when he thought how intense
must have been the suffering that could work so
great a change. But now that he was safe at
home again, there was no cause but for rejoicing.
His presence there afforded abundant proof that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
he had <i>not</i> been shot while attempting to run the
guards at Shreveport, as had been reported.</p>

<p>And how great must have been the joy which
that mother felt at beholding him once more!
Although he did not move about the house in his
accustomed noisy, boyish way, and although his
cheek had been paled by his recent sickness, from
which he had not yet wholly recovered, he was
still the same lively, generous Frank whom she
had so freely given up to the service of his country.
During the short time that they had been
separated, he had been placed in situations where
his courage and determination had been severely
tested, and had come safely through, never forgetting
his mother's advice; and that mother could
not suppress the emotions of pride that arose in
her heart, for she knew that her son had done his
duty.</p>

<p>Numerous were the questions that were asked
and answered, on both sides. Frank was obliged
to relate, over and over again, the story of his
capture and escape, until Aunt Hannah thrust her
head into the room, with the announcement that
supper was ready.</p>

<p>When the meal was finished, Frank removed his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
trunk into his study. Every thing there was just
as he left it: the fore-and-aft schooner, and the
box inclosing the scene at sea, still stood upon
the bureau; his sporting cabinet hung on the
frame at the foot of the bed; the little clock on
the mantel-piece ticked as musically as in days
of yore; and the limb of the rose-bush that covered
his window flapped against the house just as
it did the night when it was broken off by the
storm.</p>

<p>After he had taken a fond, lingering look at
each familiar object, he went into the museum, accompanied
by his mother and sister, while Brave
ran on before. Julia opened the door, and there
stood the wild-cat, just as he looked when the
young naturalist had encountered him in the
woods. Frank remembered how the cold sweat
had started out from every pore in his body when
he first found himself face to face with this "ugly
customer," and he could not help smiling when he
thought how terrified he was. As he walked
slowly around the museum, examining all the
specimens, as though he had never seen them before,
he thought over the little history of each.
There was the buck that he and Archie had killed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
in the lake, when they lost their guns, and the
latter had wished they "had never seen the deer."
Then came the owl, which Frank had shot on that
rainy morning when Archie had felt so certain of
his prize. Then there was the white buck, which
the boys had rescued from the wolves only to
have him killed by a panther. Next came the
moose with which Frank had struggled so desperately
in the woods, and from which he had
been rescued by the trapper and his dog. The
skin of the bear, which he had trapped, and followed
to the cave, and that of the panther that
killed the white buck, still hung on a nail behind
the door, where he had left them after his return
from the woods.</p>

<p>After examining every thing to his satisfaction,
he went into the shanty behind the museum,
where he kept his pets. The raccoons, which had
become so tame that Julia allowed them to run
about, started away at his approach; but the
squirrels and otter recognized him at once; and
while one ran down into his pockets in search for
nuts, the other came toward him, uttering a faint
whine, and looked up as if expecting the piece of
cracker which Frank, in former days, had always
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
taken especial care to provide for him. While
Frank was caressing the little animal, the king-birds
and crow flew into the shanty. The former
were now five in number, the old birds having
raised a nestful of young ones, which were no less
efficient in driving every bird from the orchard, or
less lenient to the crow, than their parents. The
old king-birds lit on Frank's shoulders, while Daw
seemed to prefer his master's uniform cap, and
was about to take possession of it, when his enemies
straightway commenced a fight, and the poor
crow, after a desperate resistance, was driven from
the shanty.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reader would like to know what
has become of the young moose and the cubs
which Frank captured during his visit at the
trapper's cabin. Well, they have good quarters,
and are well provided for at Uncle Mike's, the
same who assisted the young naturalist on the
morning when we saw him trying to get his scow
up to his work-shop. The moose has about an
acre of pasture allowed him. He is as tame and
gentle as ever, never attempting to escape. Uncle
Mike has put this entirely out of his power, for
he is surrounded by a ten-rail fence. The animal
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
more than pays for his keeping, and many a load
of wood has he drawn up to Mike's door for the
use of his family.</p>

<p>The cubs, which are considerably larger than
when we last saw them, are a source of a great
deal of annoyance to the honest Irishman. They
are still as playful as ever, and amuse themselves
all day long in turning somersaults and wrestling
with each other; but Mike has learned to "stand
from under." He can generally defend himself
against the attacks of one of the cubs, but the
other is always ready to lend assistance, and the
Irishman is invariably worsted. He keeps them
confined in a building that once served as a
smoke-house; and not daring to trust himself
within reach of their paws, he gives them their
food through the window.</p>

<p>It was dark before Frank had seen and heard
enough to satisfy him to return to the cottage.
The evening was spent in listening to his stories
of gun-boat life on the Mississippi, and it was
midnight before he retired to his room. The
Newfoundlander, which had been close at his master's
side ever since he returned, scarcely leaving
him for a moment, followed him into his study,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and took possession of the rug before the door.
After winding up the clock that stood on the
mantel, and setting the alarm, Frank put out the
light, and tumbled into bed. Although he was
pretty well tired-out, he did not hesitate a moment
to answer the summons of the little bell that rang
at four o'clock, but was out on the floor almost
before the notes of the alarm had ceased. In a
few moments he was dressed; and taking his fish-pole
and basket, which hung on the rack at the
foot of the bed, accompanied by Brave, set out
with the intention of paying a visit to the lake in
the swamp, which had been the scene of the fight
with the buck.</p>

<p>As he walked along up the road, the associations
connected with each locality were recalled to
his mind. Here was the place where the black
fox, which had so long held possession of Reynard's
Island, had crossed the creek with Sport&mdash;"the
dog that had never lost a fox"&mdash;following
close on his trail. There was the tree leaning
out over the creek, behind which Archie had
crept for concealment when in pursuit of the
canvas-backs; and a little further on was the
bridge which they had crossed on that rainy
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
morning that the geese had taken refuge in the
swamp.</p>

<p>Frank feasted his eyes on each familiar object
as he walked along, until he arrived at the end
of the road, where stood Uncle Mike's rustic
cottage. As he approached, that individual appeared
at the door, shaded his eyes with his hand,
gazed at our hero for a moment, and then sprang
out, and greeted him with&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arrah, Master Frank! is this you, me boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Mike, it's I," answered Frank,
extending his hand to the man, who shook it
heartily, while tears of genuine joy rolled down
his cheeks. "I'm back again, safe and sound."</p>

<p>"It's me ownsilf that's glad to see you,"
said Mike. "I heered you was kilt intirely by
the rebels; bad luck to the likes o' them. But
come with me, Master Frank; ye's been fightin'
rebels, but I've been fighting them varmints ye
ketched in the woods."</p>

<p>The Irishman led the way to the building in
which the cubs were confined, and opened the
blind which protected the window, to allow Frank
to look in. He could scarcely recognize in the
large, shaggy forms that were tumbling about
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
over the floor, the small, weak cubs which he had
carried for twenty miles in the pocket of his overcoat.</p>

<p>As soon as the window was opened, they raised
themselves on their haunches, and endeavored to
reach Uncle Mike's red-flannel cap, an article he
had worn ever since Frank could remember.</p>

<p>"Aisy, aisy, there, you blackguards!" exclaimed
Mike, endeavoring to ward off the blows
which the cubs aimed at him. "Can't yees be
aisy, I say? That's the way they always do,
Master Frank; me old cap seems to give 'em a
deal of throuble."</p>

<p>After amusing himself for some time in watching
the motions of the clumsy animals, Frank followed
Uncle Mike to the pen in which the moose
was kept. He had grown finely, was nearly as
large as a horse, and his head was furnished with
a pair of wide-spreading antlers, the sight of
which made Frank shudder, and recall to mind
that desperate fight in the woods, and his narrow
escape from death. The moose was very gentle,
and allowed his young master to lead him about
the yard, and would come at his call as readily
as a dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>After seeing the animal "shown off" to his
best advantages, Frank got into Uncle Mike's
skiff, and pulled up the creek toward the lake.
Half an hour's rowing brought him to the point
behind which he and his cousin had captured the
eider-ducks, and where they had first caught sight
of the buck. After making his skiff fast to a
tree on the bank, he rigged his pole, baited his
hook, and dropped it into the water. Almost
instantly a sudden jerk showed him that the "old
perch-hole" had still plenty of occupants, and in
a moment more a fish lay floundering in the
bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>We need not say that Frank enjoyed himself
hugely during the hour and a half that he remained
in the lake. The fish bit voraciously, and
the sport was exciting, especially as it had been
so long since Frank had had an opportunity to
engage in his favorite recreation. But his conscience
would not allow him to "wantonly waste
the good things of God," and, when he had caught
enough for his breakfast, he unfastened his skiff
and pulled toward home.</p>

<p>Frank spent the forenoon in recounting some
of his adventures to his mother and Julia, of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
which they seemed never to grow weary. When
Aunt Hannah announced that dinner was ready,
he lingered for a moment on the portico to watch
the movements of a flock of ducks, which, in
company with the old ones, the same that he and
Archie had captured in the lake, were swimming
about in the creek in front of the house; but, as
he was about to follow his mother into the dining-room,
he heard a loud scream, which seemed
to come from above him, and looked up just in
time to see a bald eagle swoop down upon the
ducks. The old ones uttered their notes of alarm,
and, rising from the water, flew over the cottage
toward the barn, while the ducklings darted under
the leaves of the lilies. But one was too late;
for, as the eagle arose in the air, he bore off his
prize.</p>

<p>Frank immediately ran into the house for
his gun, determined that the life of the eagle
should pay for that of the duck; but on his return
he found that the robber was already being
severely punished for the mischief he had done.
Daw and the king-birds, which seemed to have an
idea that something unusual was going on, had
attacked him with a fury that Frank had never
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
before witnessed. The eagle was flying, zigzag,
through the air, but was met at every point by his
tormentors. Frank, who dared not fire for fear
of wounding his pets, ran down the walk, sprang
over the fence, and awaited the issue of the fight,
hoping that the eagle would be compelled to take
refuge in one of the trees that grew on the bank
of the creek. Nor was he mistaken; for the robber,
finding that he could not escape his enemies,
settled down on a limb but a short distance
off, and, after deliberately folding his wings,
snapped his beak, as if defying them to keep up
the contest. The king-birds seated themselves on
the branches above his head, and commenced their
angry twittering, and Daw joined in with a loud
"caw, caw."</p>

<p>This seemed to be the first intimation that the
king-birds had received of his presence, for they
straightway flew at him, and Daw, although he had
lent effective assistance in fighting the eagle, did
not stop to resist, but beat a hasty retreat toward
the cottage. This seemed a favorable moment for
the eagle; he leaped from his perch, and was flying
off with his booty, when the report of Frank's
gun brought him to the ground. The young naturalist
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
shouldered his prize, and was starting
toward the house, when a voice called out:</p>

<p>"Halloo, there! At your old tricks again so
soon?"</p>

<p>Frank looked up, and saw Harry Butler coming
toward him. Neither had dreamed of the presence
of the other in the village, and the cordial manner
in which the two friends greeted each other proved
that their long separation had not lessened their
affection. But Frank noticed at once that his
friend was greatly changed. He looked haggard
and careworn; he was no longer the wild, impetuous
Harry; he had grown more sedate; and his
face, which had once beamed with a smile for
every one, now wore a look of sorrow, for which
Frank could not account. It is true that he noticed
that Harry carried his arm in a sling, but he
knew that it was not bodily suffering that had
caused that look of sadness.</p>

<p>"Harry, what is the matter with you?" was
his first question. "You look completely worn
out."</p>

<p>"So I am," was the answer. "Let us sit down
on this log, and I'll tell you all about it. I've
often been here to visit your folks," he continued,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
"never expecting to see you again, as I learned
that you had been captured, and afterward shot,
while trying to escape. You say I look worn out;
so would you if your only brother was a prisoner
in the hands of the rebels, held as a hostage,
and every moment expecting to be hung. George
is in that situation, and I look upon his death, not
only as a possible, but a very probable thing. It
has been a hard task for me to convince myself
that, if I should live to return home after the
war, I should be alone, as I certainly thought I
should be when I heard that you had been shot,
and that George was not much better off. I had
made up my mind to pass my furlough in the
house, for I didn't want to have any one near
me; but, now that you are here, I want to visit
all our old haunts again. Let us take a walk in
the woods. Bring your dinner along with you; I
haven't had mine yet."</p>

<p>In accordance with Harry's suggestion, a basket
was filled with eatables, and the boys bent
their steps through the orchard toward the
meadow that lay between the cottage and the
woods. As they walked along, Frank related
some of the interesting incidents of his life in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
service, and Harry finally began to recover his
usual spirits. At length they reached the cabin
in the woods, that had been the scene of the camp
on the day of the raccoon hunt, and here they
stopped to rest and eat their dinner.</p>

</div>
<p>hen they had finished every thing
in the basket, the boys threw themselves
on the grass in front of the
cabin, and Harry said:</p>

<p>"I shall never forget the last
time we made our camp here&mdash;on
the day we had that 'coon-hunt, and
Archie fell into the creek. I've thought of it a
great many times since I left home to go into the
service, and it makes me feel sad to see how
things have changed. From school-boys and
amateur hunters, who started and turned pale
when we heard the howl of a wolf or the hooting
of an owl, you and I have grown pretty well on
toward manhood; have become experienced in
scenes of danger, and have had more narrow escapes
than when we climbed up that tree to get
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
out of the reach of the wolves that were in pursuit
of the white buck. But there are some who
have not been as fortunate as ourselves. There has
been a thinning out of our ranks, and two good
fellows who have hunted with us in these woods,
and slept under the same blankets with us in this
cabin, we shall never see again; and the probabilities
are, that, if we live to return home again,
after peace has been restored, and we go tramping
around through these woods, to visit all our
old hunting and fishing-grounds, we shall miss a
third. Ben Lake and William Johnson are dead;
my brother is suffering in a rebel prison, and, from
what I have seen and heard of the manner in
which Union prisoners are treated at the South,
I never expect to see him again, even if he is not
executed. Ben Lake, you know, was a quiet,
good-natured fellow, scarcely ever saying any
thing unless he was first spoken to, and I had an
idea that he would be a little cowardly when he
heard the bullets whistling around him; but I was
never more mistaken in my life, for he won his
promotion in the very first battle in which our
regiment was engaged. When I was made captain
of our company, he received the appointment
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of first lieutenant, and an excellent officer
he made. He was a splendid rider, and when
mounted on his horse&mdash;'Thunderbolt' he called
him&mdash;he made a fine appearance. He was no
band-box officer, however, for he never shrank
from his duty, and he was above ordering one of
his men to do what he was afraid to undertake
himself. He and I were prisoners once for about
forty-eight hours, and the way it happened was
this:</p>

<p>"Our regiment, after the battle of Pittsburg
Landing, was detached from the Western army
and ordered to the Potomac. We had scarcely
been there a week before we were sent out on a
scout, with orders to capture Mosby, who was
constantly harassing us, and scatter his command.
We were out about ten days, without accomplishing
our object. Not a single glimpse did we get
of a reb, and finally we turned our faces toward
the camp. Our horses, as well as ourselves, were
nearly jaded, and the way we do there, when a
horse gives out, is to put a bullet through his
head, shoulder our saddles, and trudge along
after the column on foot, until we can find another
animal to ride. I had command of the rear
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
guard; and when we had arrived within a day's
march of camp, my horse suddenly gave out&mdash;laid
right down in the middle of the road, and couldn't
go a step further. I was in something of a fix,
and my feelings were none of the pleasantest
when I found myself sprawling in the dusty road,
and saw that my horse was used up. It was
something of an undertaking to find my way back
to camp, through a country infested with guerrillas,
and with which I was entirely unacquainted.
It is true that I could have had a horse, as several
were at once offered me by my men; but I
could not be mean enough to save my own bacon
by leaving one of those brave fellows behind; so
I told Ben to go ahead with the company, keeping
a good look-out for a horse, and if he could
find one, to send it back to me. I then shot my
animal; and it was a job I hated to do, I tell you,
for he was as fine a horse as ever stepped; he
had carried me many a long mile, and being my
constant companion for almost a year and a half,
I had become very much attached to him. But
there was no help for it; our orders were strict;
and I shouldered my saddle, and marched after
the column, which was soon out of sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"I walked along at a pretty lively pace, keeping
a good look-out on each side of the road
for horses, and now and then looking behind, half
expecting to see a squad of Mosby's cavalry in
pursuit, until I was startled by the report of a
pistol directly in front of me, and, coming suddenly
around a bend in the road, I found Ben sitting
beside his horse, which had also given out,
waiting for me to come up. As I approached,
glad enough that I was not left to find my way
back to camp alone, Ben picked up his saddle, and
glancing sorrowfully at the work he had done,
said:</p>

<p>"'There's an end of poor Thunderbolt&mdash;the
best horse in the regiment. It has no doubt saved
him many a long scout, but I never felt so sorry
for any thing in my life.'</p>

<p>"It was hard work, walking along that dusty
road, carrying our heavy saddles, and we anxiously
scanned every field which we passed, in hopes
that we should find some stray horse; but without
success. About three o'clock in the afternoon
we reached a cross-road, and then we knew where
we were. We had frequently been there on short
scouts; so, without stopping to keep any further
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
look-out for horses, we quickened our pace, and
about two miles further on, arrived at the house
of a lady with whom we were well acquainted,
and who, as we had always considered her loyal,
had been allowed to remain in undisturbed possession
of her property, which our regiment had once
defended against Mosby's men. Here we halted,
and asked the lady if she could furnish us with
some dinner. She replied in the affirmative, and
we deposited our saddles in one corner of the
room, while the woman began to bustle about.
In half an hour as good a dinner as I ever tasted
in that part of the country was served up, and
Ben and I sat down to it with most ravenous
appetites. Before sitting down, I should mention,
we took off our belts, to which were fastened
our sabers and revolvers, and laid them in the
corner with our saddles; a very foolish trick,
as it afterward proved; but, as we were within
fifteen miles of camp, we did not apprehend any
danger.</p>

<p>"After our hostess had seen us fairly started,
she said:</p>

<p>"'You will excuse me for a few moments, gentlemen,
as I would like to run over to see my sister,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
who is very sick. Will you keep an eye on the
baby?' she continued, pointing to the small specimen
of humanity in question, which lay fast asleep
in the cradle.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' answered Ben, 'I'll see to him;' and
the woman started off, leaving us to finish our dinner
and attend to the child.</p>

<p>"She hadn't been gone two minutes before the
young one awoke, and, of course, began to yell.
We didn't know what to do, for it was new
business to us. After trying in vain to make it
hush, Ben took it out of the cradle, and began to
trot it up and down on his knee. But it was no
use, and he finally put it back, determined to let
it cry until it got ready to stop, when I happened
to think of the sugar-bowl. That was just the
thing. Ben took good care to keep its mouth so
full of sugar that it couldn't yell, and we succeeded
in keeping it pretty still.</p>

<p>"In about half an hour the woman returned,
and, in reply to our inquiries, informed us that
her sister was considerably better, and she hoped
would be well in a few days. She then commenced
talking on indifferent subjects; and we finally
finished every thing on the table, and were thinking
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
about starting for camp, when some one suddenly
called out:</p>

<p>"'Here! here! Get up, you Yanks. Get up
from that table.'</p>

<p>"We looked up, and there, standing in the
door-way, with their revolvers leveled at our
heads, were two rebels&mdash;Colonel Mosby and a
corporal.</p>

<p>"'I've fixed you!' exclaimed the woman, triumphantly.
'You didn't think that while you
were stealing my chickens, and abusing me, that
I would ever have the power on my side.'</p>

<p>"The old hag had betrayed us. She had invented
the story of her sick sister, in order that her
absence might not cause us any suspicions, and
had left the child for us to take care of, so that
we should be obliged to remain until she returned.
The story of stealing her chickens, and abusing
her, was a mere pretext; for our orders to respect
her property were strict, and we had not dared to
disobey them.</p>

<p>"'There's only one thing that I am sorry for,
madam,' said Ben, coolly, 'and that is, that I
didn't choke that young one of yours.'</p>

<p>"'Come, come, there!' interrupted the colonel.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
'Get up from behind that table at once, or you
are dead men!'</p>

<p>"'We're gobbled easy enough, Harry,' said
Ben, in his usual careless manner, as we arose
from our chairs. 'Well, I suppose there's no
help for it, seeing that we have no weapons. What
do you intend to do with a fellow, Johnny?'</p>

<p>"'Take you direct to Richmond,' was the encouraging
answer, made by the corporal, as he
walked across the room and took possession of
our arms. 'Come out here!'</p>

<p>"We had no other alternative; so we marched
out in front of the house, our captors mounted
their horses, and we trudged along before them
on foot toward Centerville.</p>

<p>"You have been a prisoner, and can easily imagine
the thoughts that passed through our minds.
We saw before us a long, fatiguing march, with
hard fare, and harder treatment, and the dreaded
Libby looming up in the background. But we
were not allowed much time to commune with our
own thoughts, for Mosby immediately began to
question us in relation to the forces we had in
different parts of the country. Of course we told
him some of the most outrageous stories, but he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
seemed to put some faith in them; and when we
reached the cross-road he left us, after ordering
the corporal to take us to Culpepper.</p>

<p>"As soon as the colonel had got out of sight,
the corporal began to abuse us in the worst kind
of a manner, swearing at us, and calling us Abolitionists
and the like; and said that if he could
have his own way he would hang us on the nearest
tree. We told him that it was a mean trick
to treat prisoners in that way, and advised him
to keep a civil tongue in his head, as the tables
might be turned on him some day; but he paid no
attention to us, and kept on jawing, until finally,
just before night, we reached Centerville.</p>

<p>"We stopped at a house near the middle of the
town, where we were treated very kindly by the
people, who gave us plenty to eat, but told us
that we were fighting on the wrong side. After
supper, the corporal took us out to the barn,
where he proceeded to 'go through' us pretty
thoroughly. He robbed me of twenty dollars in
greenbacks, a watch, comb, several letters&mdash;in
short, he did not leave me any thing. After
overhauling Ben's pockets, he ordered him to
'come out of his coat,' which he did without
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
a grumble; and after cutting off the shoulder-straps&mdash;because
Ben 'wouldn't need 'em any
more,' he said&mdash;he put the coat on his own back,
locked the barn, and left us to our meditations.
As soon as the sound of his footsteps had died
away, I said:</p>

<p>"'Ben, I'm going to get out of here, if I
can.'</p>

<p>"'All right,' said he; 'feel around on the floor
and see if you can't find something to force that
door open with. How I wish I had that young
one here! I wouldn't feed it with sugar, I tell
you.'</p>

<p>"We commenced groping about in the darkness,
but not a thing in the shape of a club could
be found. Then we placed our shoulders against
the door, and pressed with all our strength; but
it was too strong to be forced from its hinges,
and the floor was so securely fastened down, that
it could not be pulled up; so, after working until
we were completely exhausted, we sat down on
the floor to rest.</p>

<p>"'We're in for it,' said Ben.</p>

<p>"'But I'm not going to Libby, now I tell you,'
I answered. 'To-morrow we shall probably start
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
for Culpepper, under guard of that corporal; and
the very first chance, I'm going to mizzle.'</p>

<p>"Ben made no reply, but I well knew what he
was thinking about. After a few more ineffectual
attempts, we then lay down on the hard boards,
and tried to go to sleep; but that was, for a long
time, out of the question.</p>

<p>"Our situation was not one calculated to quiet
our feelings much, and as we rolled about the
floor, trying to find a comfortable position, I could
hear Ben venting his spite against 'that brat.'
He did not seem to think of the woman who had
betrayed us.</p>

<p>"We passed a most miserable night, and at
daylight were awakened with:</p>

<p>"'Come out here, you Yanks. It's high time
you were moving toward Libby.'</p>

<p>"That rascally corporal seemed to delight in
tormenting us; but there was only one thing we
could do, and that was to 'grin and bear it.'
After a hasty breakfast, we again set out, the
corporal following close behind us on his horse,
with a revolver in his hand, ready to shoot the
first one that made an attempt at escape. We
kept on, stopping only once or twice for water,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
until we reached the Bull Run bridge. Here the
corporal stopped, and called out:</p>

<p>"'Come here, one of you fellers, and hold my
horse.'</p>

<p>"I did as he ordered, and the rebel dismounted,
bent down on one knee, and commenced fixing
his spur. My mind was made up in an instant.
It was now or never. Giving a yell to attract
Ben's attention, I sprang at the rebel, caught him
around the neck, and rolled him over on his back.
He kicked and swore furiously, and if I had been
alone, he would most likely have got the better of
me; but Ben, being close at hand, caught up the
revolver, which the rebel had laid on the ground
beside him, and in a moment more I had secured
his saber. He saw that further resistance was
useless, and bawled out:</p>

<p>"'Don't shoot, Yank. Don't shoot me, for
mercy's sake!'</p>

<p>"'Nobody's going to hurt you if you behave
yourself,' said Ben. 'Get up.'</p>

<p>"The rebel raised himself to his feet, and I at
once began to 'sound' him, as we call it. I got
back my watch, money, and every thing else he
had taken from us the night before. We then
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
ordered him to travel on ahead of us, and, as
Ben's feet were so badly swollen that he could
scarcely move, I told him to get on the horse,
while I walked along by his side. We passed
back through Centerville, keeping a good look-out
for rebel scouts, which we knew were in the vicinity,
but we did not meet with any of them
until along toward night, when we heard a yell,
and, looking up, saw half a dozen cavalry charging
across the field toward us.</p>

<p>"'I guess we're gobbled again, captain,' said
Ben.</p>

<p>"'Not if our legs hold out,' I answered. 'Get
down off that horse, quick. We must foot it,
now.'</p>

<p>"Ben hastily dismounted, and, catching our
prisoner by the arm, we pulled him over a fence,
through the woods, and into a swamp, where we
fastened him to a tree. We then tied a handkerchief
over his mouth, to prevent him from
making his whereabouts known to his friends, and
made the best of our way to the camp, which we
reached about daylight. We at once reported to
the colonel, who sent us back with our company
after the prisoner; but he was gone. His friends
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
had doubtless discovered him, and released him
from his unpleasant situation. The woman who
betrayed us paid the penalty of her treachery.
Her house was burned over her head, and her
husband, whom she had reported to us as dead,
but who was found concealed in the barn, was
taken back to the camp a prisoner."</p>

</div>
<p>y the time Harry had finished his
story, it was almost sundown.
Putting the cabin in order, and
fastening the door, the boys then
started for home. After a hearty supper
at the cottage, different plans for
their amusement were discussed and determined
upon. If time would allow, we might relate many
interesting incidents that transpired during the
month they spent together; how, one day, the
young moose ran away with Uncle Mike's wood
wagon and upset the boys in the road. We might,
among others, tell of the hunting and fishing expeditions
that came off, and the trials of speed
that took place on the river, when the Speedwell
showed that she had lost none of her sailing
qualities during the year and a half that she had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
remained idle in the shop; but one incident that
happened will suffice.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of the last day that they
were to pass together, as Frank's sick-leave had
expired, and he must soon bid adieu to home and
friends again, perhaps forever. This day had
been set apart for a fishing excursion; and,
bright and early, Frank was at Captain Butler's
boat-house, where he found Harry waiting for
him. When the bait and every thing else necessary
for the trip had been stowed away in the
skiff, the boys pulled into the river, and after
spending an hour in rowing about the bass-ground,
during which time they secured half a dozen fine
fish, they started toward the perch-bed, and anchored
outside the weeds.</p>

<p>Although they were remarkably successful, they
did not seem to enjoy the sport. Frank's thoughts
were constantly dwelling on the parting that must
come on the morrow. It could not be avoided,
for duty called him; and although the idea of
disregarding the summons never once entered
into his head, he could not help condemning the
circumstances that rendered that call necessary.
Harry, on the other hand, was impatient to recover
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
his health, as he wished to rejoin his command.
While he was free, and enjoying the delights
of home, his brother was languishing in a
Southern dungeon&mdash;held as a hostage for a notorious
guerrilla, who had been sentenced to death&mdash;not
knowing at what moment he might be led forth
to execution. Often, during the time that he and
Frank had been together, living over the scenes
of their school-days, had Harry's thoughts wandered
to that brother, and it had done much to
mar the pleasure he would otherwise have enjoyed.
He imagined he could see him, seated in his loathsome
cell, loaded with chains, pale and weak, (in
consequence of the systematic plan of starvation
adopted by the brutal authorities at Richmond to
render our brave fellows unfit for further service,
if they should chance to live until they were exchanged,)
but firm in the belief that he had done
his duty, and ready at any moment&mdash;for George
was far from being a coward&mdash;to be sacrificed.
Harry's thoughts, we repeat, often wandered to
the dreaded Libby, and especially did they on this
morning. And as he pictured to himself the
treatment that his brother was daily receiving at
the hands of the enemies of the government, is it
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
to be wondered if he indulged in feelings of the
deepest malice toward the inhuman wretches who
could be guilty of such barbarity?</p>

<p>"There's only this about it, Frank," he said,
suddenly breaking the silence that had continued
for half an hour; "there's only this about it: if
one hair of George's head is injured, Company
'M' of our regiment never takes any more prisoners;
and if I have no friendship for a traitor,
neither have I for such men as these who are now
approaching."</p>

<p>Frank looked up, and saw Charles Morgan and
William Gage rowing toward them.</p>

<p>"Here is the very spot," continued Harry,
"where we met Morgan when you first became
acquainted with him, on the morning when he
told such outrageous stories about the fishing
there was in New York harbor, and about his
fighting Indians in the Adirondack Mountains, in
the northern part of Michigan. William Gage,
you know, used to be first lieutenant of the "Midnight
Rangers."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember them both," answered Frank.
"But it seems to me that I heard some one say
that Mr. Morgan is a rebel sympathizer; and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Charley, of course, not having brains enough to
think for himself, is following in his father's
lead."</p>

<p>"So I have heard; but he has never said a
word against the government, and he'd better not,
for I feel just like choking somebody this morning;
and if I hate a rebel, I hold a domestic
traitor in the most profound abhorrence."</p>

<p>"Hullo, boys!" exclaimed Charles, at this moment,
coming alongside and stretching out a hand
to each of them, "how are you? I'm glad to
see you back again, Frank. But why haven't
you been around to see a fellow? You've kept
yourselves very close since your return."</p>

<p>"Yes, Harry and I have spent most of our
time in the woods," answered Frank. "But we
part again to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Going back to your ship, eh? Well, when do
you suppose you will be home again for good?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. If I live, however, I'm going
to see this war settled before I come back to civil
life again."</p>

<p>"You've had some pretty hard times since you
have been in the service, from what I hear."</p>

<p>"Rather tough," answered Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well now, you see Bill and I were too sharp
to go into any such business as that," said Charles,
knowingly. "The old man said, from the start,
that you never could whip the South."</p>

<p>"Well, your father was never more mistaken in
his life," answered Frank. "We <i>are</i> going to
bring back the seceded States, if it takes every
man and every dollar at the North. But I don't
see why you don't volunteer. How can you stay
at home?"</p>

<p>"O, it is the easiest thing in the world," answered
Charles, with a laugh. "In the first place,
I think too much of my life; and then again, I
don't care a snap which whips. I am not interested
either way&mdash;I'm neutral."</p>

<p>"You're no such thing," answered Harry, angrily.
"You never saw two dogs fight in the
street, without wanting one or the other of them
to whip, and your sympathies are either one way
or the other. There's no such thing as a neutral
in this war."</p>

<p>"Besides," said Frank, "if I were in your place,
I should be ashamed to say that I was neutral.
But I hope that you will be compelled to go into
the army. Since you have neither the intelligence
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
to determine which side is in the right, nor the
courage to fight for that side, I hope that you will
be drafted, and that you can't find a substitute."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Charles, sneeringly.
"You are very kind. But I, of course, know
that this is a free country, and a man has a right
to talk as he pleases."</p>

<p>"You have no right to utter treasonable sentiments,"
said Harry; "and another thing, I am not
going to sit here and listen to them."</p>

<p>"You are not, indeed! I don't see how you
can hinder it," replied Charles. "I say now, and
it makes no difference who hears me, that I hope
the South will whip, unless the North will allow
her to go out of the Union peaceably. I haven't
any thing against the South."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> have," answered Harry, scarcely able
to control himself. "My brother is now starving
in a rebel prison."</p>

<p>"I can't help it. I have not the least sympathy
for him. The South said, at the commencement,
that they only wanted to be let alone; and
if George hasn't any more sense than to meddle
with them, I say, let him take the consequences;"
and, as Charles ceased speaking, he dropped the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
oars into the water, and was about to row off,
when Frank seized the gunwale of his boat.</p>

<p>"Avast heaving, there, for a moment," he said,
quietly. "Charley, take back what you have
said."</p>

<p>"No, sir; I sha'n't do it. I mean what I have
said, and I won't take back any thing. Let go of
that boat, or I'll hit you," and he raised his oar
as if about to strike Frank.</p>

<p>But Harry was too quick for him. Springing
lightly into Charles's skiff, he easily wrested the
oar from him, and then, seizing him by the collar,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Take back every word you have said, or I'll
wash some of the vile rebel sentiment out of you.
I'll dump you overboard. Come, take it all
back&mdash;quick."</p>

<p>"Help! help! Bill," whined Charles, writhing
like an eel in Harry's strong grasp, "are you going
to sit there and see me abused in this manner?
Help, I tell you."</p>

<p>William looked first at Harry, then at Frank,
who had grown exceedingly tall and muscular
since the last time he had measured strength with
him in friendly contest, and made no reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, take it back," urged Harry.</p>

<p>"No, I won't," replied Charles, who, finding
that he was left to fight his own battles alone,
now began to struggle desperately. "I tell you I
won't take back any thing."</p>

<p>"Then overboard you go," said Harry. "I'll
see what effect cold water will have on you;"
and, easily lifting Charles from his feet, in spite
of his struggles, he threw him headlong into the
water.</p>

<p>"How is it now?" he coolly inquired, as
Charles appeared at the surface, looking very
forlorn, indeed. "Any more rebel sentiment in
you that wants washing out? Come in here,
you young traitor;" and, as he spoke, he again
seized him by the collar, and drew him into the
boat.</p>

<p>"Unhand me," shouted Charles, as soon as he
could regain his feet; "I'll fix you for this."</p>

<p>"Are you ready to take back what you said?"
demanded Harry, tightening his grasp.</p>

<p>"No; nor shall I ever be," was the stubborn
answer.</p>

<p>"Well, then, down you go again."</p>

<p>"No, no! don't," screamed Charles, who now
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
began to be really frightened; "I take it all
back."</p>

<p>"What do you take back?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"I don't want to see the Northern prisoners
all starved."</p>

<p>"Well, what else?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to see the Union destroyed."</p>

<p>"Go on; what next?"</p>

<p>"But I <i>do</i> wish the South could be whipped
to-morrow, and be made to stay in the Union."</p>

<p>"Well, now you are talking sense," said Harry,
releasing his hold of Charles's collar. "Of course,
I know you don't mean what you say, but I was
bound to make you say a good word for the
Union before I let you off. I have one more
favor to ask of you, and then I am done. Will
you oblige me by giving three cheers for the boys
who are fighting our battles&mdash;every day risking
their lives in defense of the old flag?"</p>

<p>Charles hesitated.</p>

<p>"I sha'n't ask you but once more, then," and
here Harry pointed to the water, in a very significant
manner.</p>

<p>Charles, knowing that he was in earnest, and
that there was no escape, gave the required
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
cheers with as good a grace as he could command.</p>

<p>"That's right," said Harry, approvingly.
"Now I have done with you, and you can
thank your lucky stars that you have got off so
easily. If you had been in the army when you
said what you did a few moments since, the boys
would have hung you to the very first tree they
could have found. Now, take my advice, and
don't let me hear of your uttering any more
such sentiments as long as I remain in the village;
if you do, I'll duck you as often as I can
get my hands on you."</p>

<p>Harry then sprang into his own skiff, and
Charles sullenly picked up his oars, and pulled
toward home.</p>

<p>"There," exclaimed Harry, "I feel better
now. I worked off a little of my indignation
on that fellow. The rascal! to tell us that
George ought to be starved for helping to maintain
the government, and that he didn't care
whether the Union went to ruin or not. Now
that I think of it, I'm sorry that I let him off so
easily."</p>

<p>"He was pretty well punished, after all," said
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Frank. "It will have the effect of making him a
little more careful."</p>

<p>At noon, the fish stopped biting, and the boys
started for home. They parted at the boat-house,
after Frank had promised to call and say "good-by"
before he left in the morning.</p>

<p>When the latter reached home he found his
trunk packed, and every thing in readiness for the
start, so that he had nothing to do but roam about
the premises, and take a last look at every thing,
as he had done on a former occasion. His mother
and sister tried to look cheerful, but it was a sorry
failure, for Frank could easily read what was
passing in their minds.</p>

<p>Morning came at length, and at eight o'clock,
to Frank's great relief&mdash;for he wished the parting
over as soon as possible&mdash;he saw the carriage approaching
which was to take him to the steamer.
A few embraces and hastily-spoken farewells, and
Frank was whirling away from his home. At
Captain Butler's he stopped for Harry, who met
him at the gate with an open letter in his hand;
and, as he sprang into the carriage, he exclaimed,
joyfully:</p>

<p>"It's all right, Frank. Here's a letter from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
George. He has been exchanged, and is now in
the hospital at Washington. The rebels, he says,
tried to starve him to death, but couldn't make
it. He is only waiting until he gets strong
enough to travel, and then he's coming home.
He's pretty well used up. When I get back to
the army, with Company 'M' to back me up,
I'll make somebody smart for it."</p>

<p>By the time Harry had finished venting his
anger against the enemies of the government,
the carriage reached the wharf, as the steamer
was moving out into the river. Frank had just
time to get on board, and a few moments afterward
the Julia Burton carried him out of sight
of the village. He stopped only a short time at
Portland; and, four days after leaving that place,
found Archie waiting for him as he sprang off
the train at Cairo. He reported to the fleet
captain, who ordered him to "take passage down
the river on the United States dispatch steamer
General Lyon," which was to sail at four o'clock
that afternoon. The cousins passed the day
together. When four o'clock came, Archie returned
to his high stool with a sorrowful countenance,
and Frank waived his adieu from the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
steamer that was to carry him back&mdash;to what?
It is well that the future is hidden from us, for
Frank would not have trod that deck with so
light a heart had he known what was in store for
him.</p>

<p>In a few days he arrived at his vessel, which
he found anchored at White River. Time makes
changes in every thing, and Frank saw many new
faces among the ship's company. The old mate
was still on board, and greeted him in his hearty
sailor style as he came over the side. After he
had reported to the captain, and had seen his
luggage taken to his room, he was joined by one
of his old messmates, whose name was Keys;
and who, in answer to Frank's inquiry, "How is
every thing?" proceeded to give him a statement
of the condition of affairs.</p>

<p>"The ship still floats on an even keel," said
he, pulling off his boots, and taking possession of
Frank's bed. "The old man is as eccentric and
good-natured as ever, sometimes flying off into
one of his double-reefed topsail hurricanes, which
don't mean any thing. All goes right about
decks, but you will find some things changed in
the steerage. There are only five officers left in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
our mess that were here when you went away,
and we have three new Johnny master's mates.
They all came down in the same box; and the
express man must have left them out in the damp
over night, for they are the softest fellows I ever
saw. They must have been brought up in some
country where such a thing as a steamboat is unknown,
for they don't know the starboard from
the port side of the ship, call on deck 'up stairs,'
and the captain's cabin goes by the name of the
'parlor.' It wouldn't be so bad if they would
only try to learn something, but they are very
indignant if any one undertakes to volunteer advice;
and, besides, they stand on their rank."</p>

<p>At this moment supper was announced, and
Frank and his friend repaired to the steerage,
where they found the mates of whom the latter
had spoken. While they were eating, the whistle
of a steamer was heard, and one of the new
mates (whose name was French, but who was
known as "Extra," from the fact that he was
perfectly useless as an officer,) ordered the waiter
to "go up stairs and see what boat it was." The
boy did not move, for it was a regulation of the
mess that when there was only one waiter in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
room to attend to the table, he was not to be sent
away. Besides, the mate had no right to give
such an order without first obtaining the permission
of the caterer.</p>

<p>"Do you hear what I tell you?" he inquired,
in a rage.</p>

<p>"Mr. French," said the caterer, quietly, "you
can find out the name of that boat after supper,
by asking the officer of the deck, or the quarter-master
on watch."</p>

<p>"But I choose to send this boy to find out for
me," replied Mr. French. "Come, go on, there,
and do as I tell you, or I will see if you can
not be made to obey the orders of your superiors."</p>

<p>"Stay where you are," said the caterer, addressing
the waiter, "and don't start until I tell
you to." Then, turning to the mate, he continued,
"You have no right to order him to do
any thing in this mess-room without first consulting
me."</p>

<p>"I haven't, eh? I wonder if this darkey
ranks me? My appointment reads that I 'am
to be obeyed by all persons under me in this
squadron.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"That boy is not subject to your orders, as
long as I am in the mess-room."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall take pains to inform myself on
that point. I'll ask the captain."</p>

<p>"Do so," said the caterer, quietly; "and if
you don't get the worst raking-down that you
have had since you have been on board this vessel,
then I am greatly mistaken."</p>

<p>The mate made no reply, but, after he had finished
his supper, went on deck.</p>

<p>"Now, Frank," whispered Keys, "just come
with me, and I will show you some fun."</p>

<p>Frank, always ready for any mischief, followed
his companion on deck, where they found Mr.
French in animated conversation with his two
friends.</p>

<p>"See here, French," said Keys, approaching
the latter in a confidential manner, "are you
going to put up with such abuse as you received
from that caterer?"</p>

<p>"I'd see, if I were in your place, whether or
not I had authority to command my inferiors,"
chimed in Frank.</p>

<p>"Certainly, so would I," said Keys. "Go and
report the matter to the old man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"That caterer ought to be brought down a peg
or two," said Frank.</p>

<p>"Well," said the mate, "I know that I have got
the right on my side; but I'm afraid, if I report
the matter, the captain will give me a blowing
up."</p>

<p>"O, that's only one of that caterer's stories,"
said Keys, contemptuously. "You see he's afraid
you will report him, and he told you what he did
to frighten you. Every body on board the ship is
trying to run down us mates; they don't seem to
care a fig for our orders; even the men laugh at
us, and the sooner they find out that we have
some authority here, the better it will be for us.
I wish I had as good a chance as you have; I'd
report the whole matter."</p>

<p>"I believe I will report it," said the mate, encouraged
by the sincere manner in which Mr.
Keys and Frank spoke. "I can't have a man
trample on my authority, when it comes from the
admiral. Is the captain in the parlor?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Frank, making use of his
handkerchief to conceal his laughter; "I saw him
go in there just a moment since."</p>

<p>The mate accordingly walked aft, and without
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
waiting to speak to the orderly, who stood at the
gangway, he opened the door without knocking,
and entered the cabin.</p>

<p>As soon as he had disappeared, Frank and his
companion ran on to the quarter-deck, and took
a position at a grating directly over the captain's
cabin, where they could hear all that went on
below.</p>

<p>"My eyes!" whispered Keys; "I wouldn't be
in Extra's boots for the whole squadron. Won't
he get his rations stuffed into him?"</p>

<p>The captain, who was at supper, looked up in
surprise, as Mr. French entered unannounced;
and, after regarding him sharply for a moment,
said:</p>

<p>"Well, sir!"</p>

<p>"I came here, sir," began the mate, "to tell
you"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take off your cap, sir!" vociferated the captain.</p>

<p>The mate, not in the least embarrassed, did as
he was ordered, and again commenced:</p>

<p>"I came here, sir"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you know what that marine is standing out
there for?" again interrupted the captain. "If
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
you don't, your first hard work will be to go to
the executive officer and find out. Now, don't you
again ever come into my cabin in this abrupt manner.
Always send in your name by the orderly.
It seems impossible to teach you any thing. But
what were you going to say?"</p>

<p>"I came here, sir," began the mate again, "to
see if I have any authority to command my inferiors
in rank. My appointment says"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"O, hang your appointment!" shouted the captain.
"Come to the point at once."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, while at supper, I ordered our steward
to go up stairs and execute a commission for
me, and he wouldn't go."</p>

<p>"Are you caterer of your mess?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then sir, allow me to inform you that you
have no more authority over those waiters in that
mess-room than you have to break open my
trunk and take out my money. If you should
need the services of one of the boys, go to the
caterer and get his consent. But I wish you
would try and learn something. You have been
on board this ship now three weeks, and are of no
more use than an extra boiler. Go to somebody
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
else in future with your foolish complaints. You
may go, sir."</p>

<p>The mate left the cabin, feeling very cheap, and
wondering what was the use of having any rank,
if he couldn't use it, and more than half inclined
to believe that the captain had no right to address
him in so rude a manner.</p>

<p>"Well, what did the old man say?" inquired
Keys, who, with Frank, had hurried forward to
meet him at the gangway.</p>

<p>"He says he will fix it all right," replied Mr.
French, averting his face, for he knew that he was
uttering a falsehood. "I knew I would get satisfaction."</p>

<p>So saying, he walked off, shaking his head in
a very knowing manner, while the two friends retreated
to the steerage, where they gave full vent
to their feelings. The circumstance was related
to the caterer, who came in a few moments afterward,
and after enjoying a hearty laugh at the
mate's expense, Frank retired to his room and
turned in.</p>

<p>About two o'clock in the morning a steamer
came down and reported that a regiment of rebels
had posted themselves behind the levee at Cypress
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Bend, and were holding the position in spite
of the efforts of three gun-boats to dislodge them,
rendering navigation impossible. The matter was
reported to the captain, who, after making himself
acquainted with the facts, ordered the Ticonderoga
to be got under way and headed up the
river.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<h3>The Fight in the Woods.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 108px;">
 <a name="chap_iv_o" id="chap_iv_o"></a>
  <img src="images/illo_062.jpg" width="108" height="160" alt="chap_iv_o" title="" />
</div>
<p>n the next day they arrived at Cypress
Bend, where they found three
"tin-clads" anchored, paying no attention
to the perfect storm of bullets
which the concealed rebels rained upon
their decks from behind the levee. As
soon as the Ticonderoga came within
range, the guerrillas directed a volley against her;
but, although her decks were crowded with men,
the fire was without effect. The boatswain's
whistle, and the order, "All hands under cover,"
rang sharply through the ship, and the decks were
instantly deserted. The second division&mdash;the one
which Frank commanded&mdash;was at once called to
quarters, and as soon as the gun could be cast
loose and pointed, an eleven-inch shell went
shrieking into the woods. It burst far beyond
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the levee. The rebels sent back a taunting laugh,
and their bullets fell faster than ever.</p>

<p>The levee which lines both banks of the Mississippi
forms a most excellent breastwork; and
behind this, a party of determined men can easily
hold twice their number at bay, unless a position
can be obtained where they can be brought under
a cross-fire. The formation of the river rendered
it impossible for such a position to be taken, and
it was evident that to anchor before the levee and
attempt to dislodge them with big guns, was worse
than useless; neither could they be beaten back
with their own weapons, for the rebels were very expert
in "bushwhacking," exposing but a very small
portion of their persons, and the best marksman
would stand but a poor chance of hitting one of
them. Some more decisive steps must be taken.</p>

<p>So thought the captain of the Ticonderoga, as
he paced up and down the turret, while Frank,
divested of his coat, was issuing his commands
with his usual coolness, now and then catching
hold of a rope and giving a pull at the gun, all
the while sending the shells into the levee, making
the dirt fly in every direction.</p>

<p>"Cease firing, Mr. Nelson," said the captain, at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
length. "It is useless to think of driving them
off in this manner."</p>

<p>"Cease firing, sir," repeated Frank, showing
that he understood the order. "Run the gun in,
lads, and close those ports."</p>

<p>The captain then ordered his vessel to be run
alongside of the Rover, (one of the tin-clads,) and,
after a few moments' consultation with her commander,
some plan seemed to have been determined
upon, for Frank was again ordered to open
a hot fire on the levee. Under cover of this,
signal was made for the other two vessels to get
under way, and proceed down the river.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nelson," said the captain, as soon as he
had seen the signal obeyed, "give the command
of your division to the executive officer, and come
down into the cabin for orders."</p>

<p>As soon as the executive could be found, Frank
gave up the command to him, and as he entered
the cabin, the captain said to him:</p>

<p>"I have ordered the tin-clads to go down the
river and land as many men as they can spare, to
get around in the rear of those rebels, and get
them out from behind that levee. They must be
got out of that, if possible, for navigation is virtually
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
closed as long as they remain there. I
shall also send our two howitzers and forty men,
of which you will take command. I need not tell
you to do your best."</p>

<p>The captain then went on deck, selected the
men, and Frank succeeded in getting them and
the howitzers safely on board the Rover, which
still lay alongside. The smoke from the gun of
the Ticonderoga completely concealed their movements,
and the rebels were entirely ignorant of
what was going on. As soon as the men were all
on board, the Rover steamed down the river and
joined the other vessels, which were waiting for
her to come up.</p>

<p>About five miles below was a point which completely
concealed them from the view of the rebels,
and behind this point the vessels landed; the crews
disembarked, and commenced marching through
the woods toward the place where the rebels were
posted. They numbered two hundred and fifty
men, and were commanded by the captain of the
Rover, who, although a very brave man and an
excellent sailor, knew nothing of infantry tactics.
The second in command was Mr. Howe, an ensign
belonging to the same vessel. He had never been
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
in a fight; and when he first entered the navy he
knew no more about a vessel than he did about
the moon. His appointment had been obtained
through some influential friends at home. He had
served in a company of state militia, however, before
the breaking out of the war, and considered
himself quite a military genius.</p>

<p>The sailors marched in line of battle&mdash;with
skirmishers in front and on each flank, and Frank,
with his battery, was in the center. In this manner
they marched for about an hour, and then a
halt was ordered, and the captain, with several of
his officers, went forward to reconnoiter, while
Mr. Howe, who was left in command, ordered
the men to "stack arms." Frank was astounded
when he heard this command, and, approaching
the officer, saluted him, and said:</p>

<p>"I object to this, Mr. Howe. I think it would
be much better, sir, to keep the men under
arms; for it is by no means certain that all the
rebels we shall be obliged to fight, are in front
of us."</p>

<p>"I believe you were put in command of that
battery, sir," replied Mr. Howe, haughtily, "while
I was left in charge of these men. I would thank
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
you, then, to attend to your own business, and to
let me alone."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," answered Frank. "I did
not intend to give any offense, sir, but merely to
offer a suggestion. But if I command that battery,
I intend to have it in readiness for any
emergency. Cut loose those guns, lads, and stand
to your quarters!"</p>

<p>The reports of muskets in their front proved
that the rebels were yet keeping a hot fire directed
against the Ticonderoga. But still Frank
was not deceived; he knew that all the fighting
would not be done at the front. Scarcely had
these thoughts passed through his mind, when
there was a rapid discharge of fire-arms in their
rear, and two of the men fell. As Frank had expected,
the rebels had been informed of what was
going on, and had sent part of their force to cut
the sailors off from the river. For a moment the
greatest confusion prevailed. The men, who had
been lying about in the shade of the trees, made
a general rush for their weapons, and after delivering
a straggling and ineffectual fire, hastily retreated,
with the exception of Frank's men, and
a few of the more courageous of the infantry.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
The latter concealed themselves behind trees and
logs, and deliberately returned the fire of the rebels,
while the former, who were old seamen, and
had long been accustomed to the discipline of the
service, stood at their guns awaiting orders. Mr.
Howe, for a moment, stood pale and trembling,
and then, without waiting to give any orders, disappeared
in the bushes. Frank, who was left
alone with but sixty men, was astounded when he
witnessed this cowardly conduct of his superior,
and he had hardly time to recover from his surprise,
when the rebels, after firing another volley,
broke from their concealments, with loud yells, and
charged toward the guns. This brought Frank to
his senses. With the handful of men he had left,
he could at least cover the retreat of his timid
support.</p>

<p>"Steady there, lads!" he shouted. "Aim
low&mdash;fire!"</p>

<p>The howitzers belched forth their contents, and,
as Frank had taken the precaution to have them
loaded with canister, the slaughter was awful.
The muskets had also done considerable execution,
and the rebels recoiled when they witnessed the
havoc made in their ranks. Frank, who was always
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
ready to take advantage of such an opportunity,
immediately ordered a counter-charge.
The sailors sprang at the word, with a yell, and,
led by Frank, who fixed his bayonet as he ran,
threw themselves upon the rebels, who at once
fled precipitately, leaving their dead and wounded
on the field.</p>

<p>"Back to your guns, lads," shouted Frank,
"and give 'em a shot before they get out of
range."</p>

<p>The men worked with a yell, sending the shells
rapidly in the direction in which the rebels had
retreated, until a loud roar of musketry at the
front told them that they had other enemies with
which to deal.</p>

<p>While this fight at the rear had been going on,
the sailors who had retreated had been met by
the captain and his officers, who were returning
from their reconnoissance, and, as soon as order
could be restored, an attack had been made on
the rebels who were still posted behind the levee.
In a few moments Mr. Howe came running up,
and addressing himself to Frank, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, sir&mdash;shooting into
the woods where there are no rebels? Why are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
you not at the front, where you belong? If you
are afraid to go there, you had better give up the
command of that battery."</p>

<p>Frank thought this was a nice way for Mr.
Howe to talk, after the manner in which he had
behaved a few moments before, but, without stopping
to reply, he ordered the guns to be secured,
and the men, catching up the trail-ropes, commenced
dragging the battery toward the place
where the fight was raging, while Mr. Howe
again suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p>When Frank arrived at the front, he found the
rebels were still behind the levee, where they
were exposed to a galling fire from the sailors
who were concealed among the trees, evidently
preferring to run the risk of being driven out by
the musketry than to brave the shells from the
Ticonderoga, which now began to fall into the
woods just behind them, and bursting, threw dirt
and branches in every direction. Without waiting
for orders, Frank immediately took up a
sheltered position, and straightway opened upon
the rebels a hot fire of canister. By the exertions
of the officers, the stragglers were all collected,
and, while the line was being formed for a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
charge, Frank was ordered to move his battery out
of the woods, into the open field. The young officer's
blood ran cold when he heard this command,
for the rebels, who greatly outnumbered the sailors,
and who were deterred from making a charge
and overpowering them only through fear of the
shells from the Ticonderoga, were sending a perfect
shower of bullets into the bushes where the
howitzers were stationed. Even in his present
protected position, Frank had lost five of his
men, and when he thought what a slaughter there
would be when he should move out of his concealment,
it made him shudder. But he had always
been taught that the success of the navy was
owing to "strict discipline;" and once, when he
had been reported to the captain for disobeying
an order which he had considered as unjust, that
gentleman had told him&mdash;"Always obey whatever
orders you may receive from your superiors, and,
if you are aggrieved, you can seek redress afterward."
In the present instance, this seemed
very poor policy; for what good would it do to
make objections to the order after his men had
been sacrificed? He had no alternative, however,
but to obey. The men, too, were well aware of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the danger they were about to incur, but hesitated
not a moment when Frank repeated the
order to advance. They at once pushed the guns
out into the open ground, and the effect was as
they had expected. The whole fire of the rebels
was directed against them, and every volley left
Frank with less men to handle his battery. In
fact, it soon became impossible to load the guns;
for, as fast as the men picked up a rammer or
sponge, they were shot down. It was evident
that they could not remain there.</p>

<p>"Jack," said Frank at length, turning to the
old boatswain's mate, "go and ask the captain if
I can't be allowed to move back to my old position.
I can do more execution there. Besides,
we'll all be dead men in less than five minutes,
if we remain here."</p>

<p>The man bounded off to execute the order, and
just then the captain of one of the guns was
killed. Frank immediately seized the priming-wire
which had fallen from his hand, and worked
with the rest. His fear had given place to a
reckless determination to do his duty, for, let the
consequences be what they might, no blame could
be attached to him. Impatiently, however, he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
waited for the return of the mate, and his impatience
increased when word was brought him that
the ammunition was failing. At length, after a
delay which seemed extraordinary, a charge was
ordered.</p>

<p>The rebels seemed to have an idea of what was
going on, for, a few moments before the order was
given, their fire slackened considerably; but, as
soon as the sailors, in obedience to the command,
issued from the woods, they were met with a terrific
fire, which threw them into confusion. In
vain their officers urged and commanded; the
men refused to advance, but remained standing
in full view of the rebels, while every moment
their comrades were falling around them. At
length the enemy made a counter-charge, and the
sailors, without waiting to resist, broke and fled in
every direction. Frank and his men remained at
their posts until the last moment; but they soon
found themselves completely deserted, and were
obliged to fall back into the woods.</p>

<p>By the exertions of the officers, a few of the
men were rallied in the edge of the timber, and,
bravely standing their ground, the rebels were met
with a murderous fire, and the shells from the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Ticonderoga, which now began to burst in their
very midst, completed their confusion, and they, in
turn, were compelled to retreat.</p>

<p>In an instant, Frank and several of his men
sprang out and attempted to recover the howitzers,
which had been left between the lines, but
the rebels were on the watch, and, after the loss
of three of his men, he was obliged to order a
retreat. For two hours a severe a fight was
maintained, the rebels making several charges,
which were easily repulsed by the sailors; and
each time Frank made unsuccessful attempts to
recover his battery, but was as often compelled
to retreat, leaving some of his men dead on the
field, or prisoners in the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>The left of the line rested on the bank of the
river, where a full view of the Ticonderoga could
be obtained. After the fight had raged nearly
three hours, without any advantage being gained
on either side, one of the men reported that
the ship was making signals. The commander
of the expedition hurried along the line, calling
out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Howe! Where's the signal officer, Mr.
Howe?" But he received no answer. No one
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
had seen Mr. Howe since he had so ingloriously
retreated at the commencement of the fight.</p>

<p>"Pass the word along the line for Mr. Howe!"
shouted the captain.</p>

<p>The order was obeyed, and finally a faint voice,
some distance in the rear, replied, "Here, sir."</p>

<p>"What are you doing there, sir?" demanded
the captain, in a voice of thunder. "Why are
you not at your post? Get out there with your
flag, and answer the Ticonderoga's signals." And
the captain began to consult his signal-book.</p>

<p>Mr. Howe looked first at the rebels, then at the
captain, then down at the flag which he held in
his hand, but he did not move. It was a dangerous
undertaking; for, in answering the signals,
he would be obliged to stand on the bank of
the river, where there was nothing but bushes to
protect him, and where the rebels would be certain
to see him; but the rattling of the musketry,
the sharp whistle of the bullets as they
flew thickly about among the trees, and the roar
of the Ticonderoga's guns&mdash;sounds which he had
never before heard&mdash;so worked upon the imagination
of the terrified man, that the danger seemed
tenfold worse than it really was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few moments the captain had made out
the signal, which was, "How do you succeed?"
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Mr. Howe, make the answer that we don't
succeed at all&mdash;no advantage on either side; that
our ammunition is getting scarce; and that&mdash;&mdash;.
Why don't you start, sir?" he shouted, seeing
that Mr. Howe did not move.</p>

<p>"Captain," faltered the man, in a scarcely
audible voice, "I should be very happy, sir;
very glad, indeed, sir; but&mdash;, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No remarks, sir, but do as you are ordered,
instantly."</p>

<p>"Really, captain, I&mdash;, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man could go no further, but stood trembling
like a leaf, with the utmost terror depicted
in every feature.</p>

<p>"You're a coward, sir!" shouted the captain,
in a terrible rage&mdash;"a mean, contemptible coward."</p>

<p>"I know it, sir," replied the man, so terrified
that he scarcely knew what he was saying; "but
the fact is"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74a" id="Page_74a"></a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go to rear!" shouted the captain, "and stay
there. Here, sir," he continued, turning to Frank,
who happened to be the nearest officer, "can you
make those signals?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Frank, promptly. His
face was very pale, for, accustomed as he was to
the noise and confusion of battle, he well knew
there was danger in the step he was about to take.
But his features expressed determination instead
of betraying terror. His duty must be done, whatever
the consequences might be; and hastily picking
up the flag which Mr. Howe, in his fright, had
dropped, he sprang out in view of the Ticonderoga,
made the required signals, and retreated in
safety. The rebels had seen the flag waving above
the bushes, and had directed a hot fire against it,
but, although his frail protection was riddled with
bullets, Frank escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour, during which time the
fire was warmly sustained by both parties, the
Ticonderoga again made signals, ordering the captain
of the expedition to make the best of his way
back to his vessels. Frank answered the signal,
and again retreated in safety.</p>

<p>The word had already been passed along the
line to fall back slowly, when Frank, approaching
the captain, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not wish to go back to the ship without
my battery, sir. Will you give me men enough
to recover it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I can't send any one out there to be
shot at. It is certain death, sir."</p>

<p>Frank, who thought that the captain had suddenly
grown very careful of his men, made no
reply, but hastened back to the spot where he had
left his battery. To his joy and surprise he found
one of the howitzers safe in the hands of his men;
and, as he came up, a shell went crashing toward
the rebel line, followed by a triumphant shout
from the sailors. The boatswain's mate, who had
managed to secure the gun, by throwing a rope
around the trail-wheel, was endeavoring, in the
same manner, to obtain possession of the other.
After a few ineffectual attempts, he succeeded, and
the gun was pulled back safely into the bushes.
When they had secured the remainder of the
ammunition, the men caught up the trail-ropes,
and, without delay, Frank took his old position
in the center of the retreating line. The rebels
followed them so closely that the sailors were
frequently compelled to halt and drive them back.
During one of these halts, the captain of the expedition
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
was killed. As if by magic, Mr. Howe
appeared on the scene, and, without waiting to
recover the body of his officer, gave the command
to fall back more rapidly. At length, just before
they reached the bank where they had disembarked,
the ammunition for the howitzers being
exhausted, Frank requested permission to retreat
still more rapidly, and get his guns on board
the nearest vessel.</p>

<p>"That request is in perfect keeping with your
conduct during the fight," returned Mr. Howe,
sneeringly. "The plea of saving your battery is
a very handy one; but if you are afraid to remain
here with us, you may run as fast as you
wish. I'd be ashamed to hold up my head after
this, if I were in your place."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid to remain here, sir," answered
Frank, with a good deal of spirit; "and if you
say that I have acted the part of a coward during
this fight, I defy you to prove the charge.
The idea that I am afraid, because I wish to retreat
in order to save my battery, is absurd. Run
those guns along lively, lads."</p>

<p>Frank succeeded in getting his howitzers on
board one of the tin-clads, which still lay alongside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
of the bank, without the loss of another man.
A moment afterward the sailors came pouring
down the bank. As soon as they were all on
board, the vessels moved out into the stream, and
commenced shelling the woods. While thus engaged,
the Ticonderoga came down the river, and,
after dropping her anchor, signaled for the officer
in command of the expedition to repair on board.
Mr. Howe at once put off in a boat to obey the
order, while the vessel in which Frank had taken
refuge ran alongside of the Ticonderoga, and as
soon as the battery had been taken off, the men,
covered with dust and blood, and their faces begrimed
with powder, stood silently around the
guns, while the remainder of the crew gathered on
the opposite side of the deck, and regarded their
comrades with sorrow depicted in every feature of
their sun-burnt faces. Frank knew that the fight
had been a most desperate one, and that he had
lost many of his men; but he could scarcely believe
his eyes, when he found that out of the forty
brave fellows who had started out with him in the
morning, but <i>fifteen remained</i>&mdash;more than half
had been left dead on the field, or prisoners in the
hands of the rebels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>In a scarcely audible voice he called the roll,
and his emotion increased when, at almost every
third name, some one answered:</p>

<p>"Not here, sir."</p>

<p>In a few moments the captain appeared on
deck. The report of the commander of the expedition
had, of course, been unfavorable, and the
captain's face wore a look of trouble. Hastily
running his eye over the line of dusty, bleeding
men that stood before him, he said, in a low
voice, as if talking to himself:</p>

<p>"Only fifteen left. I could ill afford to lose so
many men. You may go below, lads. Doctor,
see that the very best care is taken of the
wounded."</p>

<p>After delivering this order, the captain, who
was evidently ill at ease, turned and walked down
into his cabin.</p>

</div>
<p>s soon as the men had disappeared,
Frank, with a heavy heart, repaired
to his room to dress for supper.
He thought over all the little
incidents of the day, and frequently
detected himself in saying: "Only
fifteen men left; fifteen out of forty!"</p>

<p>What a slaughter&mdash;a useless slaughter&mdash;there
had been! And all had been occasioned by the
ignorance of the commanding officer of the expedition.
Had Frank been allowed to retain the
sheltered position which he had at first taken up,
the result would have been far different. And
how had he escaped without even a scratch? He
had stood beside his men during the whole of the
fight&mdash;freely exposing himself, and, rendered conspicuous
by his uniform, had signaled the vessel
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
twice; and each time the flag had been riddled
by bullets, but not a shot had touched him! It
seemed but little short of a miracle that he had
come off unscathed, when so many men had fallen
around him.</p>

<p>He was interrupted in his meditations by the
entrance of the orderly, who informed him that his
presence was wanted in the cabin. Frank hastily
pulled on his coat and repaired thither. As he
entered, the captain said:</p>

<p>"Take a chair, Mr. Nelson. I wish to have a
few moments' serious conversation with you."</p>

<p>Frank, surprised at the captain's tone and manner,
seated himself, and the latter continued:</p>

<p>"Are you aware, sir, that you have this day
destroyed all the confidence I have hitherto placed
in you, and have rendered yourself liable to severe
punishment?"</p>

<p>The effect of this question, so abruptly put, was
astounding, and Frank could only falter&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir? I&mdash;I&mdash;don't understand you, sir."</p>

<p>"Mr. Nelson, I am surprised at you, sir," said
the captain, sternly. "I shall have to refresh your
memory, then. You have this day been guilty
of misdemeanors, any one of which renders you
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
liable to a court-martial, and to a disgraceful dismissal
from the service. In the first place, you
have shown gross disrespect to your superior
officer, and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I guilty of disrespect, sir!" repeated Frank,
scarcely believing his ears. "There must be some
mistake, sir, for"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt me, sir. I repeat, you have
been guilty of disrespect to your superior officer,
and of cowardice, having been found with your
battery far in the rear at a time when your services
were very much needed at the front; and
then, after the fight had fairly commenced, as if
waking up to a sense of your duty, and, no doubt,
wishing to make amends for what you had done,
you, contrary to orders, recklessly exposed your
men, and, as a consequence, out of forty of the
bravest fellows that ever trod a ship's deck&mdash;which
were placed under your command this morning&mdash;you
had but fifteen left when you returned
on board. The energy displayed by you in working
your battery, and the manner in which you
obtained possession of it, after you moved out
from your sheltered position, and had been compelled
to retreat, were feats of which any officer
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
might be justly proud, and which I should have
been most happy to reward with your promotion,
had you not spoiled every thing by your infamous
conduct at the commencement of the fight. Hitherto,
since you have been on board this ship, you
have been a good officer, have always attended to
your duties, and it pains me to be obliged to talk
to you in this manner. I never thought that you,
after what you did at Cypress Bend, while you
were on board of the Milwaukee, would ever have
been guilty of such misdemeanors. However, as
your conduct heretofore has always been such as I
could approve, I shall see that no charges are made
against you; and I sincerely hope that what you
have learned to-day will be a lesson that you will
never forget. I shall give you sufficient opportunities
to make amends for what you have done,
and I shall commence by sending you ashore with
a flag of truce, to ask permission of the rebels to
bury our dead. You may start at once, sir."</p>

<p>This was a hint that his presence in the cabin
was no longer desirable, and Frank, who, in his
confusion and bewilderment scarcely knew what
he was doing, made his best bow and retired.</p>

<p>What his feelings were as he listened to this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
reprimand, administered by the captain, who never
before had spoken a harsh word to him, it is impossible
to describe. He again thought over
every thing he had done during the fight; how he
had, at the commencement of the action, beaten
back the rebels, with a mere handful of men; how
he had, in obedience to orders, taken the exposed
position where he had lost so many of his gun's
crew, and which he had held in spite of the storm
of bullets that rained around him, until the whole
line had been compelled to retreat, and he was left
unsupported; how he had twice risked his life in
signaling the ship; and how, when the retreat was
ordered he had brought back his guns in safety:
he thought of all these things, and wondered where
the charge of cowardice could be brought in.
And then, when and how had he been guilty of
disrespect to his superior officer? Certainly not
in remonstrating against ordering the men to
stack their arms, for that was a privilege to which
he, as one of the commanding officers of the expedition,
was entitled. In regard to recklessly exposing
his men, the case was not quite so clear.
It was true that, in the beginning of the fight,
he had ordered a charge upon the rebels, who
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
greatly outnumbered his own men, and had easily
driven them, without loss to himself: perhaps it
was there that the third charge had been brought
in. But although he was conscious that he had
endeavored to do his whole duty, the words of the
captain had cut him to the quick. It had been an
unlucky day for him. The expedition had proved
a failure, and he had been accused of misdemeanors
of which he had never dreamed. It
seemed as if fate was against him.</p>

<p>"I believe, as Archie used to say," he soliloquized,
"that I am the unluckiest dog in existence.
Troubles never come singly."</p>

<p>"The captain wishes to see you, sir," said one
of the men, stepping up and interrupting his
meditations.</p>

<p>"All right," answered Frank, who was so completely
absorbed in his reverie that he was entirely
unconscious of what was going on around
him; "call all hands to quarters immediately."</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;I&mdash;I don't mean&mdash;sir&mdash;the captain
wishes to speak with you, sir," repeated the
sailor, half inclined to believe that Frank was
getting crazy. This aroused the young officer to
a sense of his situation; as he approached the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
quarter-deck, where the captain was standing, the
latter said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Nelson, do you intend to go ashore with
that flag of truce, sir?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," faltered Frank, "I
forgot all about that. Will you have the kindness
to call away the first cutter?" he continued,
approaching the quarter-master, and saluting him
as the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nelson," shouted the captain, "what are
you doing? Are you crazy, sir?"</p>

<p>"I believe I am, captain, or pretty near it,"
answered Frank. "The charges that have been
brought against me have well-nigh upset me.
They are false, sir, and I don't deserve the reprimand
I have received."</p>

<p>In his next attempt to find the officer of the
deck Frank met with more success. While the
cutter was being manned, he ran down into the
steerage, and seizing a pen, hastily dashed off
the following:</p>

<p>Having been reported, by the officer in command of an
expedition&mdash;sent ashore this day for the purpose of dislodging

disrespect to my superior officer, and for recklessly exposing
my men to the fire of the rebels, and knowing, sir, that these

<p>While he was sealing the envelope the messenger
boy entered and reported the cutter ready.
Frank ran on deck, and, after giving the communication
to the captain, with a request that it
might be approved and forwarded to the Admiral,
he sprang into the boat, and gave the order to
shove off.</p>

<p>The old boatswain's mate, who was acting as
the coxswain of the cutter, had rigged up a flag
of truce. As they pulled toward the shore,
Frank waved this above his head until he elicited
a similar response from the bank; then, throwing
down the flag, he seated himself in the stern
sheets, and covered his face with his hands. The
old mate, mistaking his emotion for sorrow at the
death of so many of his men, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it is a hard case. Not a few of us are
left without our chums; but we all know it wasn't
your fault. There would have been more of us
left if you had been allowed to have your own
way."</p>

<p>"Then I did not expose you needlessly, did I,
Jack?"</p>

<p>"Why, bless you, no, sir. Who says you did,
sir?" inquired one of the crew.</p>

<p>"But tell me one thing, Jack," said Frank,
his face still covered with his hands, "Am I a
coward?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered the mate, indignantly;
"'cause if you was, you wouldn't have held on
to them guns as long as you did, and you would
not have pitched into that rebel atween the lines,
as you did about a year ago, at this very place.
In course you ain't no coward."</p>

<p>This was some consolation. The men whom he
commanded, and who had always cheerfully followed
where he had dared to lead, thought very
differently from the man who had retreated almost
before the fight had commenced, and who, to screen
himself, had brought those charges against one
whose conduct had always been above reproach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, as you say, it is a hard case, Jack," said
Frank, uncovering his face, and glancing toward
the rebels who thronged the levee. "It is a hard
case, indeed, but I will come out at the top of the
heap yet."</p>

<p>"What's the matter, sir?" inquired the mate.
"Any one been wrongin' you, sir? He'd better
not show his ugly figure-head when what's left of
the first division has shore liberty. We'll douse
his top-lights for him."</p>

<p>By this time the cutter had reached the shore,
and Frank, taking the flag of truce, sprang out,
and walked up the bank to where a group of officers
was standing.</p>

<p>"Wal, Yank, what do you want now?" inquired
a man dressed in the uniform of a colonel.</p>

<p>How Frank started when he heard that voice.
Could he be mistaken? He had certainly heard
it before, and he remembered the time when it
had given an order which still rang in his ears:
"Stiles, you stay here until this man dies." He
looked at the men, some of whom were lying
on the ground about the levee, and others standing
at a little distance, waiting to hear what
was going to be the result of the interview, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
what had at first appeared a vague suspicion, now
forced itself upon Frank as a dread reality. He
was in the presence of <i>Colonel Harrison and the
Louisiana Wild-cats</i>. Nothing but a bold front
could save him, for he knew that these men paid
very little respect to a flag of truce, unless it was
likely to further their own interests; and if he
should be recognized, his recapture was certain,
and then, what would be his fate? Would not
summary vengeance be taken upon him, in retaliation
for the manner in which he had treated the
sentinel on the night of his escape, and the way
he had served the man who had overtaken him in
the woods? Brave as Frank was, and accustomed
as he had become to look danger in the face, he
could not but regard his situation as critical in
the extreme.</p>

<p>"What did you say your business was, Yank?"
inquired the colonel again.</p>

<p>"I wish to see the commanding officer," said
Frank, steadily meeting the rebel's searching
glance. "I wish permission to bury our dead."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a fair request," said the colonel,
carelessly. "I don't know as I have any objection
to it. Want your prisoners also?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Frank, with a smile. "I
should like to take them back to the ship with me.
But you know that I have none to exchange for
them."</p>

<p>"That's what I thought. I couldn't afford to
give your men back for nothing."</p>

<p>"I didn't suppose you would. But have we
your permission to come ashore and bury our
dead?" inquired Frank, who was anxious to bring
the interview to an end.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the colonel, "and we will
leave the field in your possession. You will send
that message by one of your men, for I don't
think, youngster, that you can go back. If I am
not very much mistaken, I've got a better right
to you than any one else."</p>

<p>"Yes, colonel," shouted one of the men, "I'll
be dog-gone if I didn't think he was the chap
that give us the slip at Shreveport."</p>

<p>"I didn't think I could be mistaken," said the
colonel. "So, youngster, just consider yourself
a prisoner."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir? You have no claim
whatever upon me, and never had!" exclaimed
Frank, indignantly. "I am acting in obedience to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
orders, and am under the protection of this flag
of truce."</p>

<p>"Very well spoken. But what do you suppose
we care for that dish-rag? Besides, I say we
<i>have</i> a good claim upon you, for you have never
been exchanged. Here, Jim!" he shouted to one
of his men, "put this little Yank with the rest,
and don't give him a chance to get away this
time."</p>

<p>The man advanced to obey the order, and when
he came up to the place where Frank was standing,
he seized him by the hair and shook him until
every tooth in his head rattled.</p>

<p>"Avast heavin' there, you land-lubber!" shouted
the mate, who until this time had remained in the
boat with the crew; and, springing ashore, he ran
up the bank, and with one blow of his fist felled
the rebel to the ground.</p>

<p>"Here we have it," said the colonel, who, instead
of defending Frank, seemed to consider the
manner in which he was treated a good joke.
"Boys, secure this blue-jacket also."</p>

<p>"No you don't, Johnny!" exclaimed the mate,
as one of the men sprang forward to seize him.
"If you think that one of you is as good as five
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Yankee sailors, now is your chance to try it on.
It'll take more'n one of you to put the bracelets
on me;" and, as he spoke, he planted another of
his tremendous blows in the face of the advancing
rebel, which lifted him completely off his feet.
But before he had time to repeat it, he was overpowered
by half a dozen rebels, who had run to
the assistance of their comrade. After a hard
struggle, he was secured, and his hands were
bound behind his back.</p>

<p>"Now, you fellows," said the colonel, addressing
himself to the men in the boat, "get back to
your vessel; tell the captain how matters stand,
and also that he may come ashore and bury his
dead as soon as he chooses."</p>

<p>"Tell the first division," said the mate, "that
the next time they go into action they must give
one shot for Jack Waters. If you fellers don't
pay for this," he continued, turning to the rebels,
"then blast my to'-gallant top-lights."</p>

<p>"Tell the captain," chimed in Frank, "that he
had better not trust these men again, for they are
not sufficiently civilized to know what a flag of
truce is."</p>

<p>"You are very complimentary, young man, to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
say the least," said a rebel, who was standing near
the colonel.</p>

<p>"I am telling the plain truth," answered
Frank, "and you will find that your barbarous
mode of warfare will never succeed; and that
the crew of that vessel will never allow the mean
action of which you have been guilty to pass unnoticed."</p>

<p>"Douse my top-lights but that's the truth," said
the mate, making an effort with his confined hands
to salute his officer.</p>

<p>"See that these prisoners are well secured,"
said the colonel, "and be sure and take special
care of that youngster, for if you allow him the
least chance, he'll escape," and the colonel turned
on his heel and walked away.</p>

<p>In obedience to these instructions, Frank and
the mate were delivered into the charge of a sergeant,
who at once conducted them toward the
place where the prisoners which had been taken
during the fight were confined under guard. As
they passed along through the rebels, they were
insulted at every step, and finally a man drew
his ramrod out of his gun, and seizing Frank by
the collar, proceeded to give him a severe thrashing.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Frank immediately appealed to the sergeant,
who, instead of offering to defend him, stood at a
little distance, watching the operation, as if not at
all concerned. The mate was fairly beside himself
with rage, and struggled desperately to free
his hands, all the while venting his anger by
"dousing" his "top-lights" and "shivering" his
own "timbers." The rebel continued his punishment
amid the cheers of his companions, and at
every stroke of his ramrod he exclaimed: "Shot
the best blood-hound in Louisiana, did ye! Stick
a bayonet into young Davis, won't ye!" until
Frank, smarting with the pain, determined to defend
himself.</p>

<p>"Unhand me, you scoundrel!" he shouted;
"I've had just about enough of this." Turning
fiercely upon his persecutor, he snatched the
ramrod from his hand, and commenced laying it
over his head and shoulders. The rebel, after
trying in vain to defend himself, retreated precipitately,
amid the jeers of his comrades, and shouts
of derision from the mate. The sergeant here
thought it time to interfere, and Frank and the
mate were not again molested.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<h3>An Old Acquaintance.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 107px;">

  <img src="images/illo_100.jpg" width="107" height="160" alt="chap_vi_t" title="" />
</div>
<p>hey found that the rebels had captured
nearly twenty of their men,
several of them badly wounded,
and, as there was no surgeon with the
enemy, the poor fellows were suffering
intensely. Frank shuddered when he
thought of the inhuman treatment to
which his wounded companions had been subjected
by the very men in whose power they now were,
on the march from Vicksburg to Shreveport; and
he knew, from the scenes through which he had
just passed, that the Wild-cats had not grown
more lenient in their treatment of those who were
so unfortunate as to fall into their power. As
soon as they were placed under guard, Jack's
hands were unbound, and he seated himself on the
ground beside his officer, in no very amiable mood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"It isn't for myself that I care, sir," said he;
"but I am afraid that the treatment you will receive
will be a heap worse nor keel-haulin' on a
cold winter's mornin'."</p>

<p>"Don't talk so loud, Jack," whispered Frank,
glancing toward the guard, who was walking his
beat but a short distance from them. "I've been
in just such scrapes as this before, and I'm not
going to be strung up. If they give me the
least chance for life, I'm going to take advantage
of it."</p>

<p>"There comes a boat from the ship, sir," said
the mate. "If we could only give them the slip
now."</p>

<p>"No, sit still; we are watched too closely; wait
until to-night."</p>

<p>In a short time the cutter reached the shore,
and an officer, whom they recognized as the gunner,
sprang out with a flag of truce in his hand.
He walked straight up to Colonel Harrison.
After a short conversation with that individual,
he handed him a letter, and, accompanied by a
rebel officer, approached the place where Frank
was sitting.</p>

<p>"Well, old fellow," he said, as he came up,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
"I'm sorry to see you in this fix. But I've got
good news for you. The colonel has given me
permission to inform you that you will be well
treated as long as you remain a prisoner. You
see, we happen to have a prisoner who belongs to
this regiment on board the flag-ship, and the captain
is going to ask the admiral to exchange him
for you. So keep a stiff upper lip. Don't think
of trying to escape, and we shall see you on board
of the ship again in less than a week. Good-by."</p>

<p>Frank and the mate shook hands with the
gunner, who walked back to the place where he
had left his men, and set them to work collecting
and burying the dead.</p>

<p>After considerable trouble, an agreement was
entered into between Captain Wilson and the colonel,
and all the prisoners, with the exception of
Frank and the mate, were paroled and allowed to
return on board the vessel, after which the Wild-cats
mounted their horses and commenced marching
back into the country. While the fight had
been raging, their horses were safely hidden in the
woods, out of range of the Ticonderoga's guns;
and when they were brought out, Frank, although
he had not seen either a dead or wounded rebel,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
was able to judge pretty accurately of the number
that had been disabled in the struggle, by counting
the empty saddles. What had been done with
the dead and wounded he could not ascertain;
but the probability was, that the latter had been
carried on in advance of the main body of the
regiment, and the former hastily buried on the
field. The prisoners were each given a horse,
and Frank was a good deal surprised to find that
although the mate was closely watched, scarcely
any attention was paid to himself; his captors, no
doubt, thinking that he would prefer waiting to be
exchanged, rather than run the risk of the punishment
that had been threatened in case he was
detected in any attempt at escape. He was given
to understand that it was useless to think of flight,
for he would certainly be recaptured, even if he
succeeded in getting outside of the pickets, and
that he would be shot down without mercy. But
Frank, who well knew that the rebels would not
willingly lose an opportunity of regaining one of
their officers, was not at all intimidated by these
threats; and, as he had not bound himself to
remain a passive prisoner, he commenced laying
his plans for escape, intending to put them into
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
operation at the very first opportunity which
offered.</p>

<p>Just before dark the column halted in front of a
plantation, and commenced making its camp on
each side of the road. While the men were making
their preparations for the night, the colonel,
who evidently preferred more comfortable quarters
than could be found in the open air, repaired to
the house, where he was cordially greeted by its
inmates.</p>

<p>Frank and the mate lay down on the ground by
the side of the road, and were talking over the incidents
of the day, when a dashing young lieutenant
stepped up, and inquired:</p>

<p>"Yanks, don't you want something to eat?
Come into our mess; we want to talk to you. I'll
hold myself responsible for their safe return," he
continued, turning to the guard.</p>

<p>This individual, after a few moments' consideration,
concluded that the "Yanks could pass,"
and the prisoners followed the lieutenant to the
place where the members of the mess to which he
belonged were seated on the ground, eating their
suppers.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Yanks, at the very first good place
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
you can find," said their host. "Our chairs have
been sent on board one of your gun-boats to be
repaired, and the sofa hasn't come in yet. Do
you ever have as good a supper as this on board
your men-o'-war?"</p>

<p>"O yes," replied Frank, glancing at the different
dishes that were scattered about over the
ground, which contained corn-bread just raked out
from the ashes, salt pork, onions, and boiled
chicken, the latter evidently the fruits of a raid
on some well-stocked hen-roost. "O yes, we live
very well on board our boats. There is nothing
to hinder us, if we have a caterer worth a cent."</p>

<p>"Where do you get your grub?" asked the
lieutenant. "We steal every thing along the
shore that we can lay our hands on, just to keep
it away from you, and there are no provisions at
the North."</p>

<p>"Well, you need not believe any such story as
that," answered Frank, who could not help laughing
outright at the idea of the people at the North
having no provisions to spare. "I never knew a
gun-boat to be short of rations, except down the
Yazoo Pass."</p>

<p>"Well, then, some of our folks tell what is not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the truth," said one of the officers, who had not
yet spoken. "But, to change the subject, how
many men did you lose in the action to-day?"</p>

<p>"I am not able to tell," replied Frank. "I see
that you have taken good care to hide your loss.
I haven't seen a single wounded man since I have
been with you, and I know I saw several drop
during the fight."</p>

<p>"Yes, we did lose a few men," said the lieutenant;
"how many, you will never know. But,
to change the subject again, what did you come
down here to fight us for?"</p>

<p>"Now, see here," said Frank, setting down his
plate, which had been plentifully supplied by the
lieutenant, "you were kind enough to ask me
here to get some supper, and I don't want to
spoil a good meal by entering into a political discussion;
for, if I answer your question, I shall
tell you some pretty plain things, and I know you
will get provoked at me."</p>

<p>"O no, we are not as unreasonable as that," replied
the man. "Answer my question."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Frank, "I will make the
same reply as I once did to that question in the
prison at Shreveport. It is this: I believe that if
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
ever there was a lot of men in the world who need
a good, sound thrashing, you rebels do."</p>

<p>"That's the truth, sir," said Jack, talking as
plainly as a mouthful of salt pork would permit.
"Stand up for the old flag, sir."</p>

<p>The discussion thus commenced was maintained
for an hour, the rebels evincing the utmost ignorance
in regard to the principles for which they
were fighting; and the manner in which Frank
knocked their flimsy arguments right and left, and
the fearlessness with which he upheld the course
the government has pursued, and predicted the
speedy overthrow of the rebellion, excited their
respect and admiration.</p>

<p>At length bedtime came, and, just as Frank
and the mate were about to be conducted back to
the guard, Colonel Harrison, accompanied by two
ladies and a strange officer, walked up.</p>

<p>"Here, Yank," he exclaimed, addressing Frank,
"here's an old acquaintance of yours. Come
here."</p>

<p>As Frank obeyed the order, the strange officer
advanced to meet him, and he recognized Lieutenant
Somers. He was not at all pleased to see
him, for the lieutenant, doubtless, had not forgotten
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the circumstances connected with his capture,
and although he could not remember of ever having
treated him badly, still he feared he might
harbor some feelings of malice, and might see fit
to take a summary revenge upon him. To his
surprise, however, the rebel eagerly advanced to
meet him, and, extending his hand, greeted him
with:</p>

<p>"How are you, Nelson? You're in a fix, I
see. I am the free man now, and you the prisoner."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Frank, "I'm in for it again.
Although I was captured in violation of all the
rules of war, I suppose I must submit to it for
awhile."</p>

<p>The lieutenant passed nearly an hour in conversation
with him, talking over all the little incidents
that had happened while he was a prisoner
in the hands of Frank and his fellow-fugitives,
and was compelled to pilot them through the
country, and ended by saying:</p>

<p>"Although you were sometimes obliged to use
me rather roughly, you did the best you could
under the circumstances, and I shall let you see
that I don't forget favors. I'll speak to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
colonel, and get him to furnish you with quarters
at the plantation to-night."</p>

<p>The lieutenant then left them, and shortly
afterward a corporal and his guard came up, and
conducted Frank and the mate to the plantation,
where they were confined in a deserted negro
cabin. A few blankets had been spread out on
the floor to serve as a bed, and, had they been
among friends, they could have passed a very
comfortable night.</p>

<p>As soon as the corporal had locked the door
and retired, the mate, who had been examining
their quarters, said:</p>

<p>"I wish, sir, that lieutenant hadn't taken so
much interest in you, 'cause we're in Darby now,
sure."</p>

<p>"We are much better off than we would be out
in the camp," answered Frank. "Try that window-shutter&mdash;carefully,
now."</p>

<p>The mate did as he was ordered, and, to
Frank's joy, reported that it was unfastened.</p>

<p>"Now," said the latter, "the next thing is to
ascertain where the sentries are posted."</p>

<p>"There's one out aft here," replied the mate,
"'cause I can see him; and there's one at the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
gangway for'ard, 'cause I heered the corporal tell
him to keep a good look-out."</p>

<p>"We must wait until the camp is still," said
Frank, "and then we will make the attempt."</p>

<p>For two long hours the prisoners sat on their
rough bed&mdash;the mate, in accordance with the discipline
to which he had been accustomed from
boyhood, waiting for his officer to speak, and
Frank listening for the advent of that silence
which should proclaim that the time for action
had arrived.</p>

<p>Eleven o'clock came at length, when, just after
the sentry's cry of "All's well," Frank arose
to his feet, and cautiously approaching the window,
pushed open the shutter and looked out.
The sentry was seated on the ground at the corner
of the cabin, holding his musket across his
knees, now and then stretching his arms, and
yawning. Jack remained seated on the bed,
while Frank debated long and earnestly with
himself as to what course it was best to pursue.
Should they spring out and overpower the sentry
where he sat? This could not be accomplished
without a fight, for the sentry was a large, powerful-looking
man, and, without doubt, possessed of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
great strength; besides, if a struggle did ensue,
the noise would attract the attention of the guard
at the other side of the cabin, who would lend
prompt assistance, and, with these two men opposed
to them, escape would be impossible. Still,
there seemed to be no other course for them to
pursue, and Frank had already proposed the plan
to the mate, and was about to push open the
shutter and make the attempt, when he noticed
that the sentinel had leaned his head against the
cabin, and was sleeping soundly.</p>

<p>"Jack," he whispered, "get out of this window
quickly, and make the best of your way into
those bushes," pointing to a thicket that stood
about twenty feet from the cabin. "As soon as
I see you safe, I will follow. Don't make any
noise now."</p>

<p>The mate touched his cap, lingered for an
instant to press Frank's hand, then mounted
lightly into the window, reached the ground
without arousing the rebel, and, in a moment
more, disappeared in the bushes. Frank was
about to follow when the sentry suddenly awakened,
rubbed his eyes, gazed vacantly about him,
and then sank back to his former position. As
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
soon as Frank felt certain that he was asleep,
he again opened the shutter, descended noiselessly
to the ground, and, after carefully closing the
window, sprang into the bushes.</p>

<p>"Shiver my timbers, sir," whispered Jack,
seizing his officer's hand, "that was well done.
Won't the Johnnies be surprised when they call
all hands in the morning, and find us missin'?"</p>

<p>But the fugitives were by no means safe, neither
had their escape been accomplished. They were
still inside of the lines, and might, at any moment,
stumble upon a picket. But it was necessary
that they should get as far away from the camp
as possible before their escape became discovered,
and Frank, without waiting to receive the
congratulations of the mate, who now looked upon
their escape as a certain thing, threw himself on
his hands and knees, and moved slowly across
a field that extended a mile back of the cabin,
and which must be crossed before they could
reach the woods. Their progress was slow and
laborious, and it was two hours before they
reached a road which ran in the direction in
which they supposed the river to lie. Not having
seen any pickets, and now feeling quite certain
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
that they were outside of the lines, they arose
to their feet, and commenced running at the top
of their speed. The road ran through a thick
woods, but they had no difficulty in following
it, as the moon was shining brightly. Just before
daylight, they arrived at the Mississippi.
It was a pleasant sight to their eyes, and both
uttered a shout of joy when they found themselves
standing on its banks. But their spirits
fell again, when, on glancing up and down the
river as far as their eyes could reach, they could
not see a vessel of any kind in sight. They were
not yet at their journey's end. There might be
a gun-boat close by, hid behind one of the numerous
points that stretched out into the river, or
there might not be one within a hundred miles.
They must not linger, however, for they were not
free from pursuit until they were safe on board
some vessel.</p>

<p>Sorrowfully they bent their steps down the
river, listening for sounds of pursuit, and eagerly
watching for signs of an approaching steamer;
but the day wore away, and the fugitives, who
began to feel the effects of hunger, halted, and
were debating upon the means to be used in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
procuring food, when, to their joy, they discovered
smoke around a bend, and, in half an hour,
a transport, loaded with soldiers, appeared in
sight. They at once commenced waving their
hats, to attract the attention of those on board,
who evidently saw them, but being suspicious that
it was a plan of the rebels to decoy them into
shore, turned off toward the opposite bank.</p>

<p>"I should think they ought to see us," said
Frank, and he commenced shouting at the top of
his lungs. A moment afterward a puff of smoke
arose from the forecastle, and a twelve-pounder
shot plowed through the water, and lodged in the
bank at their very feet. It was then evident to
them that they had been taken for rebels. After
watching the boat until it disappeared, they again
turned their faces down the river. Night overtaking
them without bringing any relief, the fugitives,
hungry and foot-sore, lay down in the woods
and slept.</p>

<h3>A CLOSE SHAVE.</h3>

  <img src="images/illo_115.jpg" width="98" height="160" alt="chap_vii_w" title="" />
</div>
<p>hen the morning came they bent
their steps down the bank, keeping
in the edge of the woods to prevent
surprise, but not far enough
from the river to allow any boat
that might chance to pass to escape
their observation. They again began
to feel the fierce pangs of hunger, which
they endeavored to alleviate by chewing twigs
and roots. But this affording them no relief,
the mate finally proposed that they should turn
back into the country and ask for food at the
first house they could find. Recapture was
preferable to starving to death. Frank easily
turned him from his purpose by assuring him that
they would certainly be picked up during the
afternoon, or on the following morning. But
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
night came, without bringing them any relief, and
the tired and hungry fugitives again lay down
in the woods and slept.</p>

<p>About noon, on the next day, they found
themselves on the banks of a wide and deep
ravine, that ran across their path. To climb
up and down those steep banks was impossible;
their wasted strength was not equal to the
task. Their only course was to follow the ravine
back into the woods until they could find some
means of crossing it. After wearily dragging
themselves for two hours over fallen logs, and
through thick, tangled bushes and cane-brakes
that lay in their path, they emerged from the
woods, and found before them a small log-hut,
standing close to a bridge that spanned the ravine.
Hastily drawing back into the bushes, they
closely examined the premises, which seemed to
be deserted, with the exception of a negro, whom
they saw hitching a mule to a tree at the back
of the cabin.</p>

<p>"I don't see any white men there, Jack," said
Frank. "I think we may safely ask that negro
for something to eat. I hardly think there is any
danger, for, if he should attempt mischief, we
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
could soon overpower him. What do you say?
Shall we go up?"</p>

<p>"Just as you say, sir," answered the mate.
"But let us first get something to use as a belaying-pin,
in case any body should run foul of
our hawse."</p>

<p>The fugitives procured two short clubs, and
moved out of the woods toward the cabin. The
negro immediately discovered them. At first,
he rolled up his eyes in surprise, and acted very
much as if he was about to retreat; but, after
finding that the two sailors were alone, his face
assumed a broad grin, which the fugitives took for
a smile of welcome.</p>

<p>When they had approached within speaking
distance, Frank inquired:</p>

<p>"Well, uncle, is there any chance for a hungry
man to get any thing to eat in here?"</p>

<p>"Plenty ob it, massa," answered the negro.
"Go right in de house."</p>

<p>The fugitives, far from suspecting any treachery,
were about to comply; but Frank, who was
in advance, had scarcely put his foot on the
threshold, when two rebel soldiers sprang out of
the cabin, and one of them, seizing him by the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
collar, flourished a huge bowie-knife above his
head and demanded his surrender. So sudden
was the assault that Frank, for a moment, was
deprived of all power of action. But not so with
the mate, who, retaining his presence of mind,
swung his club about him with a dexterity truly
surprising, and brought it down with all the
force of his sturdy arms upon the head of the
rebel, who, instantly releasing his hold, sank to
the ground with a low groan. But before he
could repeat the blow, three more soldiers sprang
from the cabin, and, in spite of their struggles,
overpowered them; not, however, until the mate
had been stunned by a blow from the butt of a
pistol.</p>

<p>"Wal, I'll be dog-gone!" exclaimed one of the
rebels, "but this is a lucky haul of Yankees.
Tom, get some water and throw it into the captain's
face," pointing to their prostrate companion,
"an' fetch him to. The rest of you, get
some ropes an' tie these fellers' hands behind
them."</p>

<p>While the men were executing these orders,
Frank had time to scan the countenances of his
captors. They evidently did not belong to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Wild-cats, for, although that regiment was composed
of most ferocious-looking men, they appeared
like gentlemen compared with those in
whose power he now found himself. These were
a dirty, ragged, blood-thirsty looking set of men,
and, unless their countenances belied them, they
were capable of any atrocity.</p>

<p>Presently, the men who had gone into the cabin
returned with some pieces of cord, with which
they proceeded to confine the hands of their
prisoners, who offered no resistance. By the
time this was accomplished, the man whom the
mate had handled so roughly had been restored
to consciousness, and supported himself against
the cabin to collect his thoughts, while the others
stood silently by, as if awaiting his orders.</p>

<p>"Get every thing ready," he said, at length,
"and let the job be done at once. It needs no
judge or jury to decide the fate of these men,
knowing, as we do, what has befallen those of our
number who were so unfortunate as to fall into
the hands of the Federals."</p>

<p>The rebels, in obedience to the order, brought
out of the cabin two pieces of rope, which they
took to a tree that stood close by, and, coiling
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
them up in their hands, threw one end over a
limb that stretched out about six feet from the
ground, and fastened them there.</p>

<p>"Douse my top-lights," exclaimed the mate, as
he witnessed these proceedings, "but it is all up
with us, sir. They're going to swing us to the
yard-arm."</p>

<p>The horrid truth was too apparent, and Frank
was so completely unnerved that he was compelled
to lean against the cabin for support. He
was soon aroused by the voice of the leader of
the rebels, who said:</p>

<p>"This is to be done in retaliation for an order
issued by Admiral Porter, stating that he would
hang all 'guerrillas,' as he termed them, who
might be caught firing into transports along the
river. You can see the effect of that order right
here. Out of a company of a hundred of us who
entered the army at the commencement of the
war, you see all that are left. The remainder
have been killed or captured by you gun-boat
men. Those captured have suffered the penalty
of that order. They were no more guerrillas,
however, than you are, but were regularly sworn
into the service, and were detailed to harass the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
enemy in every possible manner; and, for obeying
our orders, some of us have been strung up like
dogs. We shall continue to retaliate on you until
our government receives notice that the order
has been countermanded. I will give you an
hour, and at the end of that time you must
swing."</p>

<p>"If you must execute us," said Frank, in a
husky voice, "why not let us die like men, and
not like criminals?"</p>

<p>"My men would have preferred to be shot,"
said the rebel, "but were not allowed the privilege
of choosing." So saying, the captain turned
on his heel and walked away, while Frank seated
himself on the threshold of the cabin, and repeated
his sentence with a calmness that made
him think his senses were leaving him. Could
it be possible that he had heard aright, and
that he was in reality a condemned man? When
he had entered the service, the thought that
he should be killed had never once occurred to
him. He had fully and confidently expected that
he would be permitted to live to see the end of
the war, and to return home to enjoy the society
of his friends once more. Could it be possible,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
then, that, after indulging in such bright anticipations,
he must end his life in that desolate place,
away from home and friends, in so terrible a manner?
He could not convince himself that it was
a reality. But there was the tree, with the ropes,
and the fatal noose at the end, dangling from the
limb; and there were those blood-thirsty looking
men lounging in the shade, and only waiting until
the hour granted by their leader should expire to
begin their horrid work. O, the agony of that
moment, when he could look forward and count
the very seconds he had to live! An hour! How
often and how lightly had he spoken of it! For
an hour in the life of one moving about at freedom
in the world, not knowing when death will
come, and, as is too often the case, scarcely giving
the matter a moment's thought, is a space of
time of very little importance; is carelessly spoken
of, and, when passed, no notice is taken of its
flight. But an hour to a person condemned to
die, who has heard his sentence, and who is bound,
and watched over by armed men, that he may not
escape from that sentence; who is in the full possession
of all his faculties; who can look abroad
upon the beauties of nature, and feel the soft
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
breeze of heaven fanning his cheek, but who
knows that, at the end of that time, he will be
deprived of all these faculties; that his life will
be suddenly and terribly terminated&mdash;in the case
of such a person, who can describe the thoughts
that "make up the sum of his heart's fevered
existence?"</p>

<p>It seemed to Frank that scarcely five minutes
of the allotted time had passed, when the leader
of the guerrillas arose from the ground where he
had been sitting. The signal was understood by
his men, two of whom approached the prisoners,
and conducted them toward the scaffold. The
mate had been encouraged by the example set
him by his officer, and both walked with firm
steps; their faces, although pale as death itself,
being as expressionless as marble, and bearing not
the slightest trace of the struggle that was going
on within them. Without the least hesitation they
took their stand on a log under the tree, and the
fatal ropes were adjusted. Their farewells had
been said, and the leader of the rebels had made
a signal for the log to be removed from under
their feet, when suddenly there was a sound of
approaching horsemen, and the next moment a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
party of the Wild-cats galloped up, headed by
Colonel Harrison and Lieutenant Somers. A few
harshly-spoken orders rung in Frank's ears; he
saw the leader of the guerrillas fall, pierced by a
dozen bullets, and then all was blank to him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let us now return to the Wild-cats, whom Frank
and the mate had so unceremoniously deserted.</p>

<p>The escape was not discovered until morning,
when the orderly sergeant went to the cabin to
call them. It was scarcely daylight, and quite
dark inside of the cabin, and as the sergeant
opened the door, he vociferated:</p>

<p>"Come, Yanks! get out of this and get your
grub!"</p>

<p>The echo of his own voice was the only reply
he received. After waiting a moment, he repeated
the summons in a louder tone, and still
received no answer.</p>

<p>"I'll be dog-gone if them ar Yanks don't sleep
at the rate of more'n forty miles an hour," said
the sergeant to himself, as he entered the cabin
and commenced feeling around in the dark to
find his prisoners. "Come now, Yanks!" he exclaimed,
"none of your tricks. I know you
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
heered me. Get up, I say, and get your grub,
for it is high time we were movin'."</p>

<p>Still no answer. The rebel finally threw open
the window-shutter, and by the straggling rays of
light that came in, he found, to his utter amazement,
that his prisoners were gone. With one
bound he reached the open air, and without paying
any attention to the inquiries of the guard as
to what was the cause of his strange behavior, he
started for the house, where he hurriedly asked
for the colonel.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now, sergeant?" inquired
that gentleman, appearing at the door with his
boots in his hand.</p>

<p>"The prisoners, sir," began the sergeant&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, what's the trouble with them?" asked
the colonel, who was very far from guessing the
facts of the case. "Won't the lazy Yankees get
up? Punch 'em with your bayonet a little if they
get unruly; that will put life into them, and keep
them civil at the same time."</p>

<p>"I could manage them easy enough, sir, if
they were here," answered the sergeant; "but,
sir, they"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"If they were <i>here</i>," repeated the colonel, who
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
now began to suspect the truth. "If they were
here! Have you allowed them to escape?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, we didn't <i>let</i> them; they went without
asking us!"</p>

<p>"A plague on you lazy scoundrels," shouted
the colonel, in a rage. "Let loose that blood-hound
at once, and pursue them. No; stop!
Tell the officer of the day that I want to see
him."</p>

<p>The sergeant started off to execute the order;
and the colonel, after pulling on his boots, entered
the house, where Lieutenant Somers and the
people of the plantation were assembled, awaiting
breakfast.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, colonel?" inquired the
lieutenant. "Any thing wrong?"</p>

<p>"Don't bother me with your foolish questions
now," replied the colonel roughly, pacing up and
down the floor with angry strides. "It's enough
to upset any one's patience. That little Yankee
has escaped again."</p>

<p>"Escaped!" repeated all in the room, holding
up their hands in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes; escaped&mdash;gone&mdash;mizzled&mdash;cleared out,"
said the colonel, frantically flourishing his arms
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
above his head; "and unless I catch him, which
I don't expect to do, I'm short a captain, for
he was to have been exchanged for one of my
officers."</p>

<p>At this moment the officer of the day entered,
and the colonel, turning to him, continued:</p>

<p>"That rascally little Yankee has escaped again.
I thought I had him safe this time, but he has
succeeded in giving me the slip when I least expected
it. That sailor that we captured with him
has gone too. Send a squad in pursuit of them
at once. Use the blood-hound, but hold him in
the leash, and don't injure either of the prisoners
if you can avoid it."</p>

<p>The officer bowed, and left the room; and the
colonel, after giving orders that the case should
be investigated, in order to see who was to blame
in allowing the prisoners to escape, mounted his
horse, and, accompanied by Lieutenant Somers,
set out in pursuit of the squad, which had already
started and was following the trail of the fugitives,
led by a large blood-hound, which was kept
in check by a chain held by one of the men. In
a couple of hours they arrived at the place where
Frank and the mate had been fired upon by the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
steamer, and here the trail was lost. After several
hours spent in unavailing search, the squad
separated, and, for two days, scoured the country
every-where, looking in vain for traces of the
fugitives.</p>

<p>At the end of that time, the colonel, completely
disheartened, collected his forces, and was
returning to the plantation, when they were met
by a negro, in a great state of excitement, who
anxiously inquired for the commanding officer.</p>

<p>"Get away from me, boy," shouted the colonel,
impatiently, "and don't bother me now."</p>

<p>"But, sar," persisted the negro, "Massa
Thorne done kotched two white gemman, an' be
gwine to kill 'em, shore."</p>

<p>"Bill Thorne in this part of the country
again!" said the colonel. "He'd better keep
clear of me. He and his pack of horse-thieves
are more injury to us than a Yankee gun-boat;"
and the colonel, without waiting to hear any more,
put spurs to his horse, and galloped off.</p>

<p>"These two white men he caught," said Lieutenant
Somers, "what were they? Yankees?"</p>

<p>The negro replied in the affirmative, and then
proceeded to give a full and complete description
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
of the prisoners, so that the lieutenant knew in
a moment that they were Frank and the mate.
After questioning him as to the locality where the
execution was to take place, he galloped down the
road, and soon overtook the colonel, to whom he
related the circumstance. The latter at once ordered
part of his men to follow him, (directing
the others to keep on the trail, so that, in case
the negro was misleading them, no time would
be lost.) As we have seen, he arrived just in
time to save his prisoners; one moment more,
and he would have been too late.</p>

<p>The guerrillas were so completely surprised
at the approach of the cavalry, and so dismayed
at the death of their leader, that they did not
think of retreat until it was too late. The Wild-cats
had surrounded them, and the sight of half
a dozen revolvers leveled at their heads caused
them to throw down their weapons and cry for
quarter.</p>

<h3>Taking Down the Captain.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 103px;">

  <img src="images/illo_130.jpg" width="103" height="160" alt="chap_viii_w" title="" />
</div>
<p>hen Frank's consciousness returned,
he found himself lying on the floor
of the cabin, where the fight had
taken place which resulted in his
capture by the guerrillas, his head
supported by a dirty blanket, rolled
up to serve as a pillow, and the
mate sitting on a three-legged chair beside him.
Through the open door could be seen a squad
of the Wild-cats, lounging under the shade of the
trees.</p>

<p>Slowly the recollection of the scenes through
which he had passed, the sentence he had heard
pronounced, the preparations he had seen made
for his execution, came to his mind, and he instinctively
put his hand to his throat, as if expecting
to find it encircled by the fatal rope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you on an even keel now, my hearty?"
asked the mate.</p>

<p>"Where are the guerrillas, Jack?" asked Frank.
"Are we safe?"</p>

<p>"O yes, we're safe from them, but we are still
prisoners."</p>

<p>At this moment a shaggy head, nearly covered
up with a slouch hat, was thrust in at the door,
and a voice inquired:</p>

<p>"Are you all right now, Yank? If you are,
come out here, for we must be off."</p>

<p>Frank, although very weak, was able, with the
assistance of the mate, to walk out of the cabin,
where they found several of the rebels mounted,
and waiting for them. They were each given a
horse, after which the Wild-cats closed about
their prisoners, as if to put all further attempts
at escape out of the question, and conducted
them down the road at a rapid gallop.</p>

<p>As soon as Frank's ideas had fairly returned,
he began to make inquiries in regard to the singular
manner in which he and the mate had been
rescued, and learned that the men by whom they
had been captured were guerrillas, in spite of
what they had said to the contrary; that they
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
made war on rebel as well as Union people, and
being especially obnoxious to Colonel Harrison&mdash;from
whom they had stolen several horses&mdash;they
had been summarily disposed of. At first Frank
could scarcely credit the statement that they had
been rescued through the agency of the very
negro to whom they owed their capture; but,
after being assured that such was the case, it
occurred to them that their approach had first
been discovered by the rebels in the cabin, and
that the negro, to save his own life, had acted
in obedience to their orders; and then, to make
amends for what had at first appeared to be an
act of treachery, he had conveyed the news of
their capture to Colonel Harrison.</p>

<p>As soon as they had fairly started, the orderly
sergeant galloped up beside Frank, and inquired:</p>

<p>"Yank, how did you get out of that cabin that
night? Nobody don't seem to know nothing
about it."</p>

<p>"I have already told him, sir," said the mate,
"that we walked by the sentinel when he was
asleep; but he don't believe it."</p>

<p>Frank then proceeded to give an account of the
manner in which their escape had been effected,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and as it corresponded with the mate's story, the
sergeant was compelled to believe it.</p>

<p>"Purty well done," said he. "But, mind you,
don't go to tryin' it on agin, 'cause, if you do,
it's the colonel's orders that you both go in double
irons."</p>

<p>Having delivered this piece of information, the
sergeant rode up to the head of the column. The
prisoners did not again attempt to escape, for
they knew that it would be an impossibility.
They were closely watched, not a single movement
escaping observation. Wherever they went,
two stalwart rebels were at their heels; and when
they slept, their guards stood over them with
loaded muskets. That same evening they overtook
the main body of the regiment, and on the
sixth day after their rescue from the guerrillas,
they arrived opposite the village of Napoleon,
where the exchange was to take place. The Ticonderoga
was not there, but two days afterward
she made her appearance; and, as soon as she
had dropped her anchor, a boat was seen approaching
the shore with a flag of truce flying in
the bow. The colonel waved his handkerchief in
reply. As the boat drew near, Frank saw two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
men in rebel uniform seated in the stern-sheets,
and he knew, from the remarks made by the
Wild-cats, that one of them was the officer for
whom he was to be exchanged.</p>

<p>As soon as the boat touched the shore, the
executive officer sprang out, followed by the two
rebels. After a moment's conversation with the
colonel, the former advanced toward Frank and
the mate, and, after greeting them cordially, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Come aboard the ship, boys; you belong to
Uncle Sam once more."</p>

<p>The mate could scarcely believe that he, too,
was exchanged. He had expected nothing less
than a long confinement in Vicksburg, or perhaps
a march to Shreveport; but, as it happened,
the captain of the Ticonderoga had found
a rebel soldier on board the flag-ship, and had obtained
permission from the admiral to exchange
him for the mate.</p>

<p>"Yes, Yanks," said the colonel, "you are at
liberty to make yourselves scarce as soon as you
choose."</p>

<p>The prisoners lingered only to shake hands
with Lieutenant Somers, who had treated them
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
very kindly, and had often found means to procure
them many little privileges and comforts,
and then ran down the bank and sprang into the
boat, which at once pushed from the shore and
started toward the Ticonderoga. As Frank came
over the side, the officers crowded around him,
asking innumerable questions in relation to the
treatment he had received while in the hands of
the rebels; but he was scarcely allowed time to
answer one-half of their inquiries before he was
summoned into the presence of the captain.</p>

<p>That gentleman greeted him in the most cordial
manner, requesting him to be seated and relate
his adventures. Frank gave a minute description
of the manner in which he had transacted the
business intrusted to him with the flag of truce,
his recapture by the Wild-cats, and the circumstances
that had led to the retention of the boatswain's
mate; recounted the plans he had laid for
their escape, their reception by the guerrillas,
and, finally, the rescue from a horrible death, to
all of which the captain listened attentively.
After Frank had finished, the captain said:</p>

<p>"It is, of course, needless to say that I am
overjoyed to see you safe on board the ship
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
again, Mr. Nelson, and that you have returned
none the worse for your sojourn among the rebels.
I am especially glad, because I wish to make you
an explanation. You have been misrepresented
to me, and I was very hasty in reprimanding you
as I did on the day that you behaved so gallantly
in the fight at Cypress Bend. It was on account
of the report of Mr. Howe, who assumed command
of the expedition after the captain had been killed.
His report showed that we had been severely
whipped; and when I learned what a slaughter
there had been of the men I placed under your
command, and which I find, upon inquiry, was
caused by the ignorance of your superior officer,
and not by any fault of your own&mdash;I say, when
I heard of this, I was so completely disheartened
that I scarcely knew what I was about. It was
the first time that ever an expedition that I had
planned failed, and also the first time in my life
that I ever gave the order to retreat; and as I
had every reason to hope for success, you can
have some idea of how I felt. After you had
gone, many facts came to light, of which no mention
was made in Mr. Howe's report, and with
which I was, of course, unacquainted, and I find
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
that I have done you a great injustice. If ever
a man earned a shoulder-strap, you did at that
fight. I have, however, sent in your application
for a court of inquiry, and have also represented
the case to the admiral. As soon as we arrive
at the flag-ship, you will report to him, and he
will investigate the case."</p>

<p>Frank, as can easily be imagined, listened to
this statement with a much lighter heart than
when he had received that unjust reprimand.
After the captain had finished questioning him
in relation to incidents that had transpired during
his captivity, he left the cabin, and went forward
into the steerage, where he found his mess just
sitting down to dinner.</p>

<p>"Well, Frank," exclaimed Keys, as the former
entered and took his place at the table, "was the
captain glad to see you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he appeared to be," replied Frank.</p>

<p>"I thought as much. He has been as uneasy
as a fish out of water ever since you were captured.
He told the executive officer that if there
was any thing he had ever done that he regretted,
it was that he had given you that blowing up.
He said that he had no right to talk to you as he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
did, and that he would make amends for it at the
very first opportunity."</p>

<p>"Did he?" inquired Mr. French, eagerly. "I
was certain that the navy regulations state distinctly
that the captain of a vessel has no right
to reprimand an officer, and that, if he does do it,
he can be made to apologize. He once gave me
a blowing up, and said that I was of no more account
on this ship than an extra boiler; and, if
he has apologized to Mr. Nelson, he must do the
same by me. I'll go and see him immediately
after dinner."</p>

<p>The effect of this speech on the older members
of the mess can be easily imagined. They looked
at Mr. French for a moment, to see if he was
really in earnest, and then burst into a fit of the
most uproarious laughter. The idea of forcing
the captain of a gun-boat to apologize to one of
his subordinate officers for administering a reprimand
that he really deserved, was ludicrous in
the extreme. Mr. Keys was the only one who
could keep a straight face. He, with his ready
wit, at once saw that here was a capital chance
to satisfy his love of mischief. He dropped his
knife and fork, looked first at one, then at another,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
and, when the noise had subsided, said,
quietly:</p>

<p>"I don't see where the laugh comes in. Perhaps
some of you gentlemen think that an officer
has no right to demand an apology from a superior!
Then I can tell you that you are very
much mistaken, for I have got the whole thing in
black and white, copied from the navy regulations;
and, if I was in Mr. French's place, I
would make the captain take back what he said,
or I would report him."</p>

<p>We must pause here, for a moment, to say that
the result of Mr. French's interview with the
captain, when the former had complained that his
rank was not respected, had become known. Mr.
Keys, who had overheard every word of it, and
who was one of those uneasy, mischief-loving
fellows who always liked to see some one in
hot water, considered the joke as too good to be
kept, and had told it, confidentially of course,
first to this officer, then to that one, until every
person on board the ship had become acquainted
with the particulars; and thus far Mr. French had
been compelled to bear the jokes of his messmates
without any chance of obtaining redress.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
However, he had discovered it at last. The captain
had apologized to Frank, and he must do the
same by him, if he wished to keep out of trouble.
He was certain that he should succeed this
time, for he knew that Keys had been in the service
long enough to become well acquainted with its
rules and regulations, and there was such apparent
truthfulness and sincerity in what he said, that
Mr. French was certain of bringing the captain
to terms.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," repeated Keys; "if my superior
officer abuses me, I shall seek redress. Because
a man wears three or four stripes of gold lace
around his arms, he has no right to impose upon
me."</p>

<p>"I shall see the captain about it as soon as I
have finished my dinner," said Mr. French, decidedly.</p>

<p>"You had better let that job out," said the
caterer, who, being a very quiet, staid sort of a
person, did not wish to see any disturbance.
"You will remember that you got a blowing up
once for not taking my advice. I have been in
the navy longer than you, and you had better
listen to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know that you have more experience than
myself," answered French; "but that experience
doesn't tell you that a captain can use me as
he pleases. I have rank as well as he has.
Besides, you see, I have the advantage this
time."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," chimed in Keys, winking at Frank,
who struggled hard to suppress a laugh, "and,
if you will only push the matter, you will see
some fun on this ship."</p>

<p>Here the subject was dropped. Immediately
after dinner was finished, as usual, the officers
all congregated under the awning on the main-deck.
Mr. French walked up and down the deck,
conversing earnestly with his two friends, who,
entirely ignorant of what might be the consequences
of such a step, were urging him to seek
an interview with the captain, to demand an apology,
which would certainly be given, and would
show the ship's company that they <i>had</i> rank, and
that it must be respected.</p>

<p>Frank had for some time missed Keys, and
was wondering what had become of him, when he
discovered that individual on his hands and knees
behind the pilot-house, beckoning eagerly. Frank
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
walked toward him carelessly, so as not to attract
the attention of Mr. French and his friends, and,
as he came up, Keys said, in a hurried whisper:</p>

<p>"See here, Nelson; you know I told French
that I had the rules and regulations all copied
down in my order-book. Now, it has just occurred
to me that he might want to see them; so
I want to write something to show him. I can't
get to my room without his seeing me, so I wish
you would lend me your key."</p>

<p>Frank accordingly produced it; but his conscience
reproved him when he thought in what an
unpleasant position his friend was endeavoring to
place Mr. French.</p>

<p>"Look here, Keys," said he, "I propose that
you don't carry this joke any further. It will get
the poor greenhorn in a bad fix."</p>

<p>"I can't help it," returned Keys. "I have
often volunteered to give him advice, and have
tried to convince him that if he ever wants to understand
his business he must make use of somebody's
experience besides his own. But he has
always snapped me up very short. Now, if he
wants to learn by experience, I'll help him all I
can."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>So saying, Keys crawled off on his hands and
knees toward Frank's room, where he locked himself
in, and the latter returned to the main-deck.
About an hour afterward Keys made his appearance,
walking rapidly across the deck, as if
searching for something that he was in a great
hurry to find, and thus attracted the attention of
Mr. French and his two friends, who took him
familiarly by the arm and led him forward, out of
ear-shot of the other officers, who were still seated
on the main-deck.</p>

<p>"See here, Keys," said French, "I understood
you to say that you had the regulations in relation
to the treatment of subordinate officers,
copied in your order-book. Will you allow me
to look at them?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said Keys, "I remember. Here's
something that relates to it;" and he produced
his memorandum-book, and pointed to an article
hastily written in lead pencil, which ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>And be it further enacted</i>: That, as in the maintenance
of his authority over his officers on shipboard, it is rendered
necessary that the commanding officer should, in all
cases, treat his subordinates as gentlemen, all harsh words
from a commanding officer to an officer of lower grade are
hereby strictly prohibited; and in all cases where the commander
is guilty of a violation of this act, the person
aggrieved shall be, and is hereby, authorized to seek redress."</p>

</blockquote>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, gentlemen," exclaimed Mr. French,
after he had carefully read the article, "is an
act of the American Congress, which authorizes
me to seek redress. All harsh words in the navy
are strictly forbidden; and if the captain does
not apologize for what he said to me, I'll report
him."</p>

<p>"You will please excuse me, gentlemen, for the
present," said Keys, who was finding it exceedingly
difficult to control himself. "The turret
must be got ready for inspection at sundown;"
and, thrusting the book in his pocket, he walked
rapidly below.</p>

<p>Mr. French immediately moved aft, and, drawing
himself up very stiffly, said to the orderly:</p>

<p>"Tell the captain that I have business with
him."</p>

<p>The marine disappeared, and soon returned
with a request that he would walk into the cabin.
The captain was seated at his table, writing; but,
as the mate entered, he dropped his pen, turned
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
in his chair, and waited for him to make known
his wants[Period Missing? P2]</p>

<p>"Captain," began Mr. French, hesitatingly,
for he scarcely knew how to commence the conversation,
"I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;have been reading the
navy regulations, and I find that I have been
abused."</p>

<p>"Who has abused you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, sir," began the mate&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I asked you who had been abusing you, sir,"
interrupted the captain. "Answer my question,
and make your explanations afterward."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, to come to the point, you have
abused me, sir."</p>

<p>The captain started back in surprise, and
looked at the mate for several moments, as if to
make sure that he was in his right mind, and
then quietly asked:</p>

<p>"How have I abused you, sir?"</p>

<p>"In reprimanding me, sir. The navy regulations
distinctly state that a commanding officer
has no right to use harsh words to his subordinates;
and I demand an apology."</p>

<p>"Can you furnish me with a copy of those
regulations?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir; Mr. Keys has them," replied the
mate; and he left the cabin, and commenced
searching for that individual.</p>

<p>We should remark that Mr. Keys was pretty
well aware that he would be likely to get himself
into hot water. Wishing to delay the interview
between himself and the captain as long as
possible, he had retreated to the hold, where he
appeared to be very busily engaged; but, as soon
as Mr. French made known his errand, he readily
produced his book, glad indeed that he was to
be let off without seeing the captain. The mate
carried it into the cabin. The captain read over
the article several times, and then arose from
his seat, and, going to one of the after-ports,
appeared to be busily engaged with his own
thoughts. Mr. French stood watching him with
a smile of triumph, certain that the captain had
been worsted, and that he would soon receive the
required apology; but, had he been a keen observer,
he would have seen that the captain was
convulsed with laughter, which he was vainly endeavoring
to conceal. He easily saw through the
trick, and it reminded him of the days when he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
was a midshipman, and had been implicated in
similar jokes.</p>

<p>"Mr. French," said he, at length, "you may
retire for a few moments. I will send for you
presently. Orderly, tell Mr. Keys that I wish to
see him."</p>

<h3>A Practical Joke.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;r. Keys, who began to be really
afraid that the plan he had adopted
for assisting his green messmate
to "learn by experience" was about
to rebound with redoubled force on
his own head, was found by the orderly
in earnest conversation with
Frank, to whom he always went for advice.</p>

<p>"It's getting hot, Nelson," said he. "What
shall I do? I'm in for my share of the rations
this time, sure."</p>

<p>"Make a clean breast of it," replied Frank.
"You will only get yourself in trouble if you do
not, for the captain knows exactly how the matter
stands."</p>

<p>The mate had already determined to make a
full confession; but, nevertheless, his feelings, as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
he entered the cabin, were not of the most pleasant
nature. His reception, however, was far different
from what he had expected. The captain,
as we have seen, was one of the most reasonable
men in the world, if approached in the proper
manner, and if he saw that an officer endeavored
to do his duty, he was very patient with him;
if he found that a reprimand was necessary, it
was administered in the most friendly manner;
but if he once took it into his head that an officer
had willfully, or through negligence, omitted
a portion of his duty, then, as the ship's company
used to remark, it was "stand from under." Mr.
Keys was a great favorite with the captain, as he
was with all his brother officers, who admired his
dashing style and his good-natured disposition.
He was never idle, but was always hurrying about
the ship, as if the well-being of every person on
board depended upon himself, and, as a consequence,
his duty was always done, and the deck of
which he had charge was kept in the nicest order.</p>

<p>As he entered the cabin the captain greeted
him with a smile. Pointing to a chair, he inquired,
as he commenced turning over the leaves
of the memorandum-book:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Keys, is this some of your work?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered the mate.</p>

<p>"Well, what in the world possessed you to
hoodwink Mr. French in this manner?"</p>

<p>"Because, sir, he has often informed me, when
I have undertaken to instruct him, that he wishes
to learn every thing by experience, sir. I have
been assisting him."</p>

<p>"Do you think he has improved any with your
help?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; he has learned that his authority in
the mess-room is not equal to that of the caterer."</p>

<p>"Well, I thought you had a hand in that affair,"
said the captain, "and now I wish to give you a
piece of advice. I, myself, have often been in
such scrapes as this, and have been brought up
with a round turn. This reminds me of a little
incident that happened while I was a midshipman
on the Colorado. The story has grown old by
this time, but it will be considered a good one as
long as the navy shall exist. There were eight of
us in the mess, and while we were lying at the
navy-yard we had nothing to do but to play tricks
upon each other, and upon every one who came in
our way. Our ship was commanded by a commodore
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
who never bothered his head about us so long
as we remained within bounds. As is always the
case, we abused our privileges, grow's bolder by
degrees, until finally the commodore taught us a
lesson that we never forgot.</p>

<p>"One pleasant afternoon, as we were lounging
about the decks, waiting for something to turn
up, we saw a green-looking specimen of humanity
come over the side, and, in an instant, were on
the alert. He, probably, had never been on board
of a man-o'-war before, for he stared with open
mouth at every thing he saw. Here was a chance
for us, and as soon as the officer of the deck had
walked aft, out of sight, we collared the countryman,
and led him back to our mess-room.</p>

<p>"'By gum, but you have got every thing nice
here,' said he. 'I'd like this better than workin'
on a farm.'</p>

<p>"'Ah, you ought to go up in the commodore's
cabin if you want to see something nice,' said a
midshipman, who was our leader in all sorts of
mischief. 'But, look here, my friend, if you wish
to remain with us, you must have on a uniform.
No civilians are allowed to stay here.'</p>

<p>"We all took this as a hint, and commenced
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
rigging the Yankee out in our clothes. One furnished
him with a coat, another a pair of pants,
another a cap, and I gave him a sword that had
just been presented to me.</p>

<p>"'Now,' said our leader, 'do you want a good
dinner&mdash;one of the very best?'</p>

<p>"'Sartin,' replied the countryman. 'Got any?'</p>

<p>"'No; but the commodore has, and it is just
about his dinner time.'</p>

<p>"We then explained to him that he must go up
to the cabin and tell the commodore that he had
just been ordered to the ship; and, in accordance
with his usual custom, the old gentleman would be
certain to invite him to dinner.</p>

<p>"'He is very cross sometimes,' said we, 'but
don't be at all afraid of him&mdash;he doesn't mean
any thing. Talk to him as though he was your
father.'</p>

<p>"'By gum, I kin do that,' said the Yankee,
and off he walked, while we took up a position
where we could hear and see all that passed.</p>

<p>"The commodore was seated at his desk,
writing, and the countryman at once walked up
to him, slapped him familiarly on the shoulder,
and shouted:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Hullo, ole hoss! how de do? Shake hands
with a feller, won't ye?'</p>

<p>"The commodore looked up in surprise, and
ejaculated:</p>

<p>"'Eh! What do you want here? Get out of
this. Away you go.'</p>

<p>"'O no, ole hoss, not by a long shot,' replied
the Yankee, coolly seating himself in the nearest
chair. 'Them ar young fellers down stairs told
me to come up here and git some dinner; and, by
gravy, I ain't goin' till I git it; so fetch it on.'</p>

<p>"Of course, it was as plain as daylight to the
commodore that we were at the bottom of the
whole affair, for the countryman never would
have had the audacity to act in such a manner,
unless some one had put him up to it, and he determined
to punish us in a manner that we had
not thought of.</p>

<p>"'Look here, my man,' said he, 'do you see
that soldier out there?' pointing to a marine that
was pacing back and forth before the gangway.
'Well, he has got a loaded musket, and unless
you get off this ship instantly, he will shoot you.
Now, away you go, you land-lubber, and don't
stop to talk to any body.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"We saw our victim moving off, and were convulsed
with laughter at what we considered to be
the best joke we had ever perpetrated. We supposed,
of course, that he would return with our
clothes, but you can imagine our astonishment
when we saw him walk down the gang-plank and
out on to the wharf. We held a hurried consultation,
and then I started for the cabin, and, making
my best bow, asked permission to step ashore
for a moment.</p>

<p>"'No, sir,' replied the commodore; 'no shore
liberty is to be granted to-day.'</p>

<p>"In short, we all lost our clothing&mdash;every thing
that we had loaned the countryman&mdash;and a more
crest-fallen set of midshipmen one never saw.
We endeavored to keep the affair a secret, but
the commodore told it to the first lieutenant, and
from him it soon spread, until the entire ship's
company were acquainted with the particulars.
We were very careful after that, and never undertook
to play any more jokes on the commodore.
There are many things objectionable in this custom&mdash;for
I can call it nothing else&mdash;which is so
general among young officers, of playing off tricks
upon each other; and your jokes are getting a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
little too practical. If you must indulge in them,
I wish you would endeavor to keep them out of
the cabin, for I don't like to be bothered. That
will do, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Keys retired, highly pleased with the result
of his interview with the captain, and went
straight to Frank, to whom he related every thing,
and showed him the sham "regulation" in his
memorandum-book, which had been the cause of
so much merriment.</p>

<p>Mr. French was soon afterward seen to emerge
from the cabin, where he had listened to a lengthy
lecture, containing advice which, if followed, would
in future prevent all difficulty. Of course, all the
officers were soon made acquainted with the affair,
and many were the inquiries, in Mr. French's
hearing, as to what kind of an apology the captain
had made. It is needless to say that he was
fully convinced that "experience is a hard taskmaster,"
and that it is well enough, especially on
shipboard, to take advice.</p>

<p>A few days after the events which we have
just been relating transpired, the Ticonderoga
arrived at Yazoo River. In obedience to his
orders, Frank reported on board the flag-ship.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Owing to a press of business, it was nearly a
week before the court of inquiry was convened.
Scarcely an hour was passed in the examination
of the witnesses, during which time the main
facts of the case were developed, Frank completely
vindicated, and Mr. Howe, who had reported
him, was sent on board of ship in disgrace.
The same evening the former received his promotion
as acting ensign, accompanied by orders to
report on board of the Trenton for duty.</p>

<p>"I am very glad, for your sake, Mr. Nelson,"
said the captain, "to be able to give you this
promotion, but very sorry for my own. I regret
exceedingly that you are detached from this vessel,
but it is something over which I have no control.
I am perfectly satisfied with your conduct since
you have been with me. If you will attend to
your duties in future as well as you have since
you have been here, I will answer for your rapid
advancement."</p>

<h3>New Messmates.</h3>

</div>
<p>he next morning, immediately after
quarters, the second cutter was
called away; and Frank, after seeing
his luggage safely stowed away in
her, shook hands with his brother officers,
who had gathered on the quarter-deck
to see him off, and started toward
his new vessel.</p>

<p>The cutter had made, perhaps, a dozen yards
from the Ticonderoga, when Frank observed a
commotion among the crew assembled on the
main-deck, and the old mate, mounting one of the
boat-davits, shouted:</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Mr. Nelson!"</p>

<p>The cheers were given with a will, and Frank
answered them by taking off his cap. It was one
of the happiest moments of his life. He knew
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
that while attached to the Ticonderoga he had endeavored
to do his whole duty. The shoulder-straps
which he wore showed that his services had
been appreciated by the captain, and the hearty
expression of good feeling which had just been
exhibited by the men, afforded abundant proof
that he had left no enemies among them.</p>

<p>When he arrived alongside of the Rover, he
found the officer of the deck, boatswain's mate,
and side-boys standing on the after-guard, and
Frank was "piped over the side" with all the
ceremony due his rank. It made him feel a little
embarrassed at first, for never before had so much
respect been shown him. But he knew that he
had won the uniform he wore by hard knocks,
and was more entitled to this honor than those
who sported ensign's shoulder-straps which had
been obtained, not by any skill or bravery of their
own, but by the influence of friends at home.</p>

<p>Frank made known his business, and was immediately
shown down into the cabin. The captain,
who had often met him on board of the
Ticonderoga, and who had heard of his exploits,
greeted him cordially, and was glad to learn that
he had received such an acquisition to his crew.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
When he had endorsed Frank's orders, he sent for
the chief engineer, to whom he introduced him,
with a request that he might be made acquainted
with the other officers of his mess; after which
Frank was shown to his room, whither his luggage
was soon conveyed.</p>

<p>Just before supper he was introduced to the
officers belonging to the ward-room mess; but
when he had seated himself at the table, and listened
a few moments to the conversation that followed,
he found that some of his new messmates
went by names very different from those by which
they had been introduced. One of the ensigns,
whose name was Andrews, was known as Count
Timbertoes, from the very dignified manner in
which he always conducted himself, and from his
wooden-leg style of progression.</p>

<p>The executive officer, whose name was Short,
answered to its opposite&mdash;Long; and sometimes,
behind his back, he was called "Windy." Frank
was not long in discovering why it was that such
a name had been given him, for he was certainly
the most talkative man he had ever met; and
when asked the most simple question, instead of
answering it by a plain Yes or No, he would "beat
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
about the bush," and deliver a regular oration on
the subject. He had a great command of language,
and seemed desirous of making every one
whom he met acquainted with the fact.</p>

<p>The paymaster went by the name of Young
Methuselah. He was a man about twenty-seven
years of age, but the account kept by one of the
engineers, who messed in the steerage, made him
about two hundred and eighty years old. There
was scarcely a trade or profession in the world
that, according to his own account, he had not followed
for five or ten years. He had been a shoemaker,
a painter, a grocer, a horse-jockey, and an
editor; had practiced medicine, traveled in Europe,
and, when a mere boy, had been master of
as fine a vessel as ever sailed out of Boston. He
was a "self-made man," he said, and early in life
had started out with the intention of seeing the
world. This was the reason he gave for following
so many different occupations.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of the officers, he disliked very
much the name they had given him, and had often
complained to the caterer of the mess, and finally
to the captain. The former took no measures to
correct it, and the latter "didn't want to be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
troubled with mess affairs," and so the paymaster
was compelled to bear his troubles, which he did
with a very bad grace, that only made matters
tenfold worse. It was a noticeable fact, however,
that, whenever any of the officers were in need of
money, he was always addressed as <i>Mr.</i> Harris,
but as soon as the money had been obtained, or
the safe was empty, he was plain Methuselah
again.</p>

<p>The chief-engineer's name was Cobbs, but he
went by the name of Gentleman Cobbs, from the
fact that he was always dressed in the height of
fashion, sported his gold-headed cane and patent-leather
boots about decks, and had never been
known to "do a stitch of work" since he had been
on board the vessel.</p>

<p>These names were, of course, applied only in
the mess-room, for the captain was a regular
naval officer, a very strict disciplinarian, and any
such familiarity on deck would have brought certain
and speedy punishment on the offender. On
the whole, Frank was very well pleased with his
new messmates; they seemed to be a set of generous,
good-natured men, and, aside from the
grumbling of the paymaster, which was kept up
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
without intermission from morning until night, but
which received no attention from the other members
of the mess, every thing passed off smoothly.
The ward-room was kept scrupulously clean and
neat, and the manner in which all the delicacies
of the season were served up bore testimony to
the fact that, although Gentleman Cobbs was very
much averse to work, he well understood the
business of catering, and was fond of good living.</p>

<p>After dinner, the officers belonging to both the
steerage and ward-room messes congregated on
the main-deck, under the awning, to smoke. During
the conversation the carpenter, who went by
the name of "Chips," remarked, as he wiped the
big drops of perspiration from his forehead:</p>

<p>"This boat is intolerable. I would like to be
where I was six years ago this summer."</p>

<p>"Where was that?"</p>

<p>"I was in a whale-ship, off the coast of Greenland.
I was tired enough of it then, but now
I'd like to have just one breath of air off those
icebergs."</p>

<p>"So would I," said the paymaster. "It would
be so refreshing."</p>

<p>At this, a little, dumpy man, who had sat lolling
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
back in his chair, with his hat pushed down over
his eyes, and his cigar, which he had allowed to go
out, pointing upward toward his left cheek, started
up, and carelessly inquired:</p>

<p>"Were you ever there, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, when I was a youngster. I went up
there just to see the country. I spent five years
on the voyage."</p>

<p>The dumpy man made no answer, but there was
a roguish twinkle in his eye, as he drew a little
memorandum-book from his pocket, and, after deliberately
placing it on his knee, proceeded to
make the following entry, on a page which was
headed "Chronological Tables," and which was
covered on one side with writing, and on the other
by a long column of figures:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Paymaster spent on voyage to Greenland 5 years.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>After adding up the column of figures, he closed
the book and returned it to his pocket. Then,
turning to the paymaster, he quietly remarked:</p>

<p>"Four hundred and eighty-five years old!
That's doing well-extremely well. You don't
look as old as that, sir. You won't find one man
in five hundred hold his age as well as you do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect of this speech on the officers sitting
around was ludicrous in the extreme, and had the
party been in the mess-room the dumpy man
might possibly have been obliged to "run a race"
with a boot-jack, or any other missile that came
handy to the paymaster; but as it was, the latter
was compelled to choke down his wrath, and leave
the deck.</p>

<p>Frank also found that these strange cognomens
were common in the steerage; one, in particular,
he noticed. It was a master's mate, who went by
the name of "Nuisance." He was as "green"
as he could possibly be, and, although he seemed
to try hard to learn his duty, was continually
getting himself into trouble. He had a room off
the quarter-deck, (the same that Frank was to
occupy,) but seemed to prefer any other room
than his own; for, when off watch, he would take
possession of the first bunk that suited his fancy;
and, not unfrequently, boots, neck-ties, collars,
etc., which had been missed, were found upon his
person. It was not his intention to <i>steal</i> them,
for the articles were always returned after he had
worn them to his satisfaction. If an officer went
into his room to write, or to engage in any other
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
business at which he did not wish to be disturbed,
the mate was sure to be on hand, and hints were
of no avail; nothing but a direct "Clear out&mdash;I
don't want you in here," would have the desired
effect. It was this habit that had given him the
name he bore. One would suppose that after receiving
so many rebuffs he would cease to trouble
his brother officers; but he seemed to be very dull
of comprehension. The executive officer scolded
him continually. Finding that it did no good,
the officers were obliged, as a last resort, to keep
their rooms locked. Had the mate been of a
surly, unaccommodating disposition, he would not
have got off so easily; but no one could have the
heart to report him, for every one liked him.
He was always cheerful, ready to do any one a
favor, and was generous to a fault. Frank at
once took a liking to his new room-mate, but,
having been duly instructed by the others, he
took particular pains to keep all his wearing apparel,
when not in use, safely locked in his trunk.</p>

<h3>A Good Night's Work.</h3>

</div>
<p>rank's past history soon became
known to every one on
board the Trenton, for several of the
crew had acquaintances on board of
the Ticonderoga, and when they were
allowed liberty, had taken pains to inquire
into the character of their new
officer. He was scarcely allowed time to become
settled down in his new quarters, before he was
given an opportunity to establish his reputation
among his messmates. Information was received
that the rebels were intending to cross a large
body of cavalry about twenty miles above the
Yazoo River, and the Trenton was ordered up
the Mississippi to prevent it, if possible.</p>

<p>For several days they patrolled the river near
the suspected point, but nothing unusual was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
seen; neither could any intelligence of the contemplated
move be obtained from the people on
shore. There were several houses on the beat,
and in one of them lived a Frenchman, who, as he
said, having claimed the protection of his own
country, was not compelled to bear arms; neither
was he at all interested in the war. It was near
his house, however, that the crossing of the cavalry
was to take place, and the captain of the
Trenton thought that this neutral Frenchman
would bear watching.</p>

<p>Although there were several white women on
the premises, he was the only man who had been
seen; and he seemed to be in constant anxiety
lest the rebels should confiscate a large drove of
cattle he had at a pasture back in the country,
and was in the habit of riding out twice each week
to "see to them," as he said. There was something
suspicious in this, for persons as much in
want of provisions as the rebels were reported to
be&mdash;as they had gathered up all the stock in the
country for miles around Vicksburg&mdash;would not
be likely to respect such property, although it did
belong to a neutral.</p>

<p>The captain and his officers mingled freely with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the people, who appeared to be eager to communicate
all the plans of the rebels with which
they had become acquainted. Frank, as usual,
was on the watch; and if he sometimes paid a
visit to the house, he was more frequently seen
questioning the negroes&mdash;of whom there were
about half a dozen on the plantation, the others
having been compelled to leave their master to
work on the fortifications&mdash;who were either profoundly
ignorant of what was going on, or else
were true rebels. There was one negro, in particular,
in whom the young officer was interested.
He was a tall, muscular fellow, black as midnight,
about whom there was a kind of sneaking, hangdog
look that Frank did not like. He always
accompanied his master on his trips to attend his
cattle, and Frank felt confident that if any one
about the plantation knew of any thing suspicious
going on, it was this negro; but, in spite of his
efforts, he could not find an opportunity to talk
with him, for the negro was generally in the company
of his master, and, when alone, seemed to
take particular pains to avoid the young officer.
This was enough to arouse his suspicions, and he
determined to watch him closely. He reported
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the matter to the captain, who readily granted his
request that he might be allowed to spend his time,
when off watch, on shore.</p>

<p>A week passed, but nothing had been developed.
At length, one morning the Frenchman
prepared to pay his usual visit to the country.
The negro was to accompany him, and as Frank
saw them about to move off, he inquired, carelessly:</p>

<p>"Haven't you got another horse? If you
have, I should like to go with you."</p>

<p>"O, no," answered the man, quickly, "I have
no other horse; and if I had, it wouldn't do for
you to go, for you would certainly get captured."</p>

<p>This set Frank to thinking. The Frenchman
had often told him that there were no rebels in
that section of the country, and now his excuse
for not wanting company was that Frank would be
captured. There was something suspicious in this.
After seeing the man depart, he hailed the ship
for a boat, and as soon as he arrived on board,
sought an interview with the captain.</p>

<p>"I do not believe, sir," said he, "that this
Frenchman owns any stock in the country. It
is my opinion that he goes out there to hold communication
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
with the rebels. He's a sort of spy
and messenger-boy, and relies on his nationality
to protect him from suspicion."</p>

<p>Frank then related the particulars of what had
transpired at the house, and the captain readily
agreed with him. But the question was, how to
proceed, in order to ascertain what was going on,
and what kind of information was furnished the
rebels. It was impossible to follow the men on
their trips without being discovered; neither was
it policy to seize the man, accuse him of treachery,
and compel him to confess the truth, for the plot,
whatever it was, might not be completed, and it
might be necessary to keep the Frenchman in ignorance
of the fact that his complicity with the
rebels had become known, in order that, when the
work was completed, it might be finished up entirely.</p>

<p>"Well, to tell the truth," said the captain,
rising from his chair and pacing up and down the
cabin, "I really don't know how to act. That
something is wrong, I have long been satisfied;
but I don't know how to go to work to find out
what it is."</p>

<p>"I believe I can find it out, sir," said Frank,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
who, with his usual promptness, had determined
upon a plan. "They will return this afternoon
about three o'clock, and, with your permission, I'll
see what I can do."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied the captain, in a tone
which showed that he did not anticipate his success.
"Go ahead; but be careful not to excite
their suspicions."</p>

<p>Such a commission as this&mdash;something requiring
skill and judgment&mdash;was just what suited
Frank, and, having laid his plans, he felt confident
of success. At half-past two a boat was called
away, and he, in company with the mate&mdash;both
armed with revolvers&mdash;went on shore. Frank
walked up to the house and seated himself on
the portico, while the mate, previously instructed,
strolled off toward the barn.</p>

<p>There were two officers in the house belonging
to the vessel, and Frank had spent but a few
moments in conversation with them, when the
Frenchman and the negro rode up. The former
dismounted and greeted the officers with apparent
cordiality, but Frank scarcely noticed him, for his
eyes were upon the negro, who rode off toward
the barn to put up the horses. Frank arose from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
his seat and followed slowly after him. As the
officers were accustomed to roam wherever they
pleased about the plantation, no notice was taken
of his movements. When he reached the barn
where the negro was unsaddling the horses, he
entered and closed the door behind him. The
negro became terrified when he found himself thus
confronted, for suspicions that he and his master
had been discovered instantly flashed across his
mind.</p>

<p>"Ah, I know that you are guilty, you rascal,"
said Frank, triumphantly, as he noticed the man's
trepidation. "Come here; I want to have a few
moments' conversation with you on a very important
subject. Come here."</p>

<p>The negro dropped the saddle which he had
just taken from one of the horses, and stood for
a moment undecided how to act; then springing
forward like a tiger, he thrust the officer aside,
and endeavored to open the door. Quick as
thought, Frank grappled with him, but the negro
was a most powerful fellow, and would no doubt
have succeeded in escaping, had not the mate
sprang from a manger, where he had lain concealed,
and felled him to the floor with a blow
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
from the butt of his revolver. For some time he
lay insensible, in spite of the buckets of water
which were dashed over him; but at length he
began to recover. When he was able to sit up,
the mate stationed himself at the door to guard
against surprise, and Frank proceeded to interrogate
the negro.</p>

<p>"In the first place," said he, "I guess you have
found that we are in earnest, haven't you?"</p>

<p>The negro felt of his head, but made no reply.</p>

<p>"Now," continued Frank, "unless you answer
every question I ask you, I'll take you on board
the ship as a prisoner. What do you and your
master go out into the country for, twice every
week?"</p>

<p>The negro still remained silent, and Frank,
finally growing impatient, exclaimed, "Here, Jack,
take this scoundrel on board the ship; I guess we
can find means to make him open his mouth."</p>

<p>"O, my master will kill me," whimpered the
negro, trembling violently. "If I don't tell you
every thing, you will kill me; and if I do, my
master will kill me, too; so I shall die any way."</p>

<p>"No you won't; just tell me the truth, and I'll
see that no one harms you. Your master need
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
know nothing about it; we shall not be likely to
tell him. Now, what is there out in the country
that you go to see so often?"</p>

<p>"Torpedoes," replied the negro, in a low voice,
gazing about the barn with a frightened air, as if
he expected to see his master appear before him
in some magical manner.</p>

<p>"Torpedoes!" repeated Frank. "Where are
they?"</p>

<p>"In a little creek about six miles from here."</p>

<p>"Who is making them? Are there any rebels
there?"</p>

<p>"Yes; there is a colonel, major, and lieutenant
there; but my master's black men are doing the
work."</p>

<p>By adroit questioning&mdash;for the negro was very
careful to answer no further than he was asked&mdash;Frank
finally gleaned the whole particulars. One
piece of information troubled him not a little, and
that was, an attempt was soon to be made to blow
up the Trenton. He also learned the number of
the torpedoes, the manner of operating with them,
and other particulars that will soon appear. He
was then as much puzzled as ever, and paced the
floor of the barn, undecided how to act. The time
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
set for the sinking of the Trenton was Friday
night, (it was then Thursday), and as information
of her movements was every day conveyed to the
rebels, the question was, how to keep them in
ignorance that their plot had been discovered,
so that the work might be carried on as usual.
There was, apparently, but one way, and that was
to hold out inducements to the negro.</p>

<p>"See here," Frank suddenly exclaimed, "you
are between two fires now."</p>

<p>"I know that," replied the negro, well aware
that he was in a most precarious situation; "I
know that. But what am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Well, this is what you must do," answered
Frank; "go off and attend to your business, just
as you did before. Of course you won't be foolish
enough to say a word about this meeting to
any one around the plantation; but if every thing
does not transpire to-morrow night just as you
said it would, I shall think that you have been
telling some one, and that the plot is discovered,
and then you're a goner. But if you will assist
me, I will take care of you; I will take you on
board the ship, and make a free man of you."</p>

<p>The negro, who had been worked up to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
highest pitch of terror at the turn affairs were
taking, brightened up when the words "free man"
struck his ear, and Frank, who was a pretty good
judge of human nature, could easily read what
was passing in his mind, and knew that in the
negro he had a faithful coadjutor.</p>

<p>"Now, if you are certain that you understand
what I mean," said he, "be off. Go out the back
door, so that no one will see you from the house;
and remember that your freedom depends upon
the manner in which you behave yourself."</p>

<p>The negro arose from the floor, and speedily
made his exit. After waiting long enough to
allow him to reach the house, Frank and the
mate slipped out of the front door. Giving the
negro quarters a wide berth, they approached the
house in a different direction from that in which
they had left it.</p>

<p>The mate had been instructed to keep the affair
a profound secret, for, now that they had succeeded
in working out so much of the plot, they
wished to have the honor of completing it.</p>

<p>After a few moments' conversation with the
Frenchman at the house, they repaired on board
the vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have returned, sir," said Frank, as he entered
the cabin.</p>

<p>"So I see," replied the captain, good-humoredly,
"and have, I suppose, accomplished nothing."</p>

<p>"No, sir; I can't say that," answered Frank,
guardedly. "I <span class="smcap">have</span> accomplished considerable.
I know that the Frenchman is a spy; that he has
daily communication with the rebels, and that his
story of visiting his stock in the country is nonsense.
He has about as many cattle there as I
have."</p>

<p>"Have you indeed succeeded?" inquired the
captain, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, no, sir, not entirely," replied Frank,
who did not know how much it was best to tell
the captain. "I have learned more than that,
but it takes time to complete the work. Before I
go further, sir, I should like authority to manage
the affair myself. After I have gone as far as I
have, I shouldn't like to be superseded."</p>

<p>"That was not my intention. No one shall be
placed over you. If you can accomplish any
thing more, do it. But what else did you hear?"</p>

<p>Frank then related the result of the interview
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
between himself and the negro, and then left the
cabin, with repeated assurances that his plans for
capturing the rebels should not be interfered
with.</p>

<p>The next day, it seemed to Frank, moved on
laggard wings; but afternoon came at length. He
then went on shore, and after having learned from
the negro that every thing was working as nicely
as could be wished, returned, and commenced
making his preparations for the night's work. At
eight o'clock he again left the vessel in a small
skiff, with two negroes for a crew, and the mate
shortly followed in the cutter, with twenty men, all
well armed. The former held up the river, and
the cutter pulled in an opposite direction. The
officers of the ship were, of course, very much
surprised at these movements. As they had not
been informed of what was going on, they thronged
the forward part of the deck, watching the expedition
as long as it remained in sight.</p>

<p>The night was dark as pitch, but it could not
have been better for their purpose; and Frank
was highly delighted at the handsome manner in
which all his plans were working, and which
promised complete success. He held his course
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
up the river until he arrived at a small creek
whose mouth was almost concealed by thick
bushes and trees. He boldly entered this creek,
but had not proceeded far when a voice hailed:</p>

<p>"Who comes there?"</p>

<p>"Death to the Yankees," promptly replied
Frank.</p>

<p>"Why, you're half an hour ahead of time,"
said the voice. "Didn't the Yanks see you as
you came up?"</p>

<p>"I'll wager a good deal they did," said another
voice. "It would be just our luck to have the
whole affair knocked in the head. But we'll
make the attempt, any way. Come up here."</p>

<p>It was so dark in the creek that Frank could
scarcely see his hand before him; but he knew
pretty well who it was addressing him. Pulling
up the creek, in obedience to the order, he came
in sight of a boat lying close to the bank, in the
shade of the bushes that hung out over the water.
In this boat were seated three men, two of whom
were holding in their hands several ropes that led
to a dark object that lay in the water astern of
the skiff.</p>

<p>"Here's the torpedo," said one of the men, as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Frank came alongside, and as he spoke he passed
the ropes over to the young officer. "Just drop
silently down the river as far as you can without
being discovered, and then cast off the torpedo,
and let it float down on to the Trenton. We'll
go up on the bank and watch the experiment."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Frank, suddenly pulling a
brace of revolvers from his pocket, "you are my
prisoners."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the negroes threw down their oars
and sprang into the skiff. Before the rebels could
draw a weapon, they were powerless in the strong
grasp of Frank's sable coadjutors. The prisoners
were the colonel and major of whom the negro at
the plantation had spoken. The third person in
the boat was one of the Frenchman's slaves, who
had rowed the boat down the creek for the rebels.
He had jumped to his feet as if about to escape,
but had been collared by one of Frank's negroes,
and thrown into the bottom of the boat, where
the fear of the revolvers kept him quiet.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of all this?" asked the
colonel, as he struggled furiously to free himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176a" id="Page_176a"></a></span></p>

<div class="pmb3"></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 519px;">

<div class="pmb3"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"It means," replied Frank, coolly, "that you
are prisoners in the hands of those you sought to
destroy. So surrender yourselves without any
more fuss. Make their hands fast, boys."</p>

<p>The negroes, who seemed to be well prepared,
drew from their pockets several pieces of stout
cord, with which they proceeded to tie the arms
of the rebels, who, finding that escape was impossible,
submitted to the operation without any further
resistance. As soon as they were secured,
Frank made the torpedo fast to the bank, after
which he and his men, with the prisoners, disembarked,
and commenced marching toward the
house. They had proceeded but a short distance
when they received a challenge, to which Frank
replied, when they were joined by three of the
crew, who had been stationed on the bank by
the mate, to capture the rebels, in case they
should escape from his officer. The prisoners
were given into their charge, and Frank continued
his march toward the house, congratulating himself
that, although his work was but half done,
he had succeeded beyond his expectations.</p>

<p>The field about the house was silent as death,
but he knew that the mate had neglected none of
his instructions, and that trusty men were hidden
all around him, ready at any moment to lend
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
effective assistance. Arriving at the door, he
pounded loudly upon it with the butt of his revolver.
The summons was answered by the
Frenchman, who gazed upon our hero with surprise,
not unmingled with a feeling of alarm.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you," said Frank. "You're
just the chap I want."</p>

<p>The Frenchman comprehended at once that he
had been betrayed. Drawing a pistol, he leveled
it full at Frank's head, but before he had time to
fire, a blow from a saber in the hands of one of
the negroes, who had followed close behind Frank,
knocked the weapon from his grasp. The next
moment the back door of the room was suddenly
opened, and the Frenchman was clasped in the
sturdy arms of the mate.</p>

<p>"Give him to some of the men, Jack," said
Frank, "and then follow me quick, or we may be
too late."</p>

<p>The order was obeyed, and the mate, accompanied
by the two negroes, followed Frank, who
led the way back to the creek where the torpedo
had been captured. They were just in the "nick
of time," for, as they approached, they distinctly
heard a voice inquire:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where's the colonel? Here's the torpedo,
made fast to the bank. I wonder if there is any
thing wrong?"</p>

<p>Frank and the mate at once became more cautious
in their movements, but their approach had
already been discovered, for the lieutenant called
out:</p>

<p>"Who goes there?"</p>

<p>"Yankees," replied Frank, stepping out from
the bushes, with a revolver in each hand. "Come
out here, and surrender!"</p>

<p>The rebel was taken so completely by surprise
that he seemed deprived of all power of action.
He could hardly realize that he was a prisoner,
until Frank repeated his order in a more decided
manner, adding, "I'm a good shot at that distance."
The lieutenant evidently did not doubt
this, for he arose to his feet, and sprang out upon
the bank. The prisoners having now all been secured,
Frank collected his men and returned on
board his vessel.</p>

<p>We will now pause to explain. Frank, as we
have seen, had learned from the negro that one
of the torpedoes would be finished by Friday
night; that it was to be towed down the creek to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the river by the colonel and major, who were to
put it in working order, and deliver it to the lieutenant,
who, with two negroes to row his boat, was
to leave the plantation at half-past eight o'clock,
to note the exact position of the Trenton, so that,
after getting the torpedo into position, he could
allow it to float down upon the vessel. The
Frenchman was to be on board, and, with the assistance
of the negroes, was to capture any who
might escape the explosion. Frank had laid his
plans to capture the lieutenant first; but, through
fear of creating a disturbance, or being seen from
the house, he had been compelled to abandon the
idea, and had started half an hour earlier, that he
might secure the lieutenant after the capture of
the others had been effected, and before he would
have time to discover that any thing was wrong.
His plans had all worked so admirably, that he
was not a little elated with his success. It was
a happy moment for him when he brought his
prisoners over the side of the vessel, and conducted
them to the quarter-deck, where the captain
and all the officers were waiting to receive
them. The necessary explanations were soon
given, after which the prisoners were ordered
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
below, and Frank retired to his room, well satisfied
with his night's work.</p>

<p>The next morning an expedition went ashore,
accompanied by the captain. After destroying
the torpedo which had been captured the night
before, they were conducted by the negro to the
place where several more were in process of completion.
These also were demolished. While
thus engaged, one of the sentinels, which Frank
had posted a short distance up the road, fired his
gun, and commenced retreating. Frank at once
formed his men in line, in readiness for an attack.
Shortly afterward a company of cavalry came galloping
around a bend in the road, and fired their
carbines at the sentinel, who ran for dear life.
They halted, however, on seeing the preparations
made to receive them, and the captain, taking advantage
of this, ordered Frank to fire. The muskets
cracked in rapid succession, and, when the
smoke cleared away, the sailors saw several riderless
horses galloping about, showing that their fire
had been effective.</p>

<p>The rebels scattered in all directions, and, dismounting,
concealed themselves behind logs and
bushes, and commenced fighting in their regular
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Indian fashion. The captain, knowing that such
an action would not result advantageously to him,
and having accomplished the work for which he
had set out, ordered the sailors to fall back slowly.
As they obeyed, the rebels commenced pursuing;
but the expedition reached the river without the
loss of a single man. The officer in command of
the vessel, hearing the firing, commenced shelling
the woods, and under cover of this fire the sailors
reached the ship in safety.</p>

<p>The work which had been assigned the Trenton
had not been accomplished, but as the time allotted
for her stay had expired, she started the next
morning to join the fleet at Yazoo River. The
prisoners were delivered over to the commanding
naval officer&mdash;the admiral being below the batteries&mdash;to
whom a flattering mention was made of
Frank, and the skillful manner in which he had
performed his work. The young officer received
the assurance that his gallant exploit should not
be overlooked.</p>

</div>
<p>he day after their arrival at Yazoo
River an officer from the flag-ship
came on board. After holding a
short consultation with the captain, the
order was given to get the ship under
way, when, as soon as the anchor was
weighed, they steamed down the river.</p>

<p>What could be the meaning of this new move?
Were their services needed below Vicksburg, and
were they about to imitate the Queen of the
West, and run by the batteries in broad daylight?
That hardly seemed to be the case, for the men
were not called to quarters, and the officers were
allowed to remain on deck. Every one was excited,
and many were the speculations indulged in
as to what was to be the next duty the Trenton
would be called on to perform. To the impatient
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
men, the seven miles that lay between Yazoo
River and Vicksburg seemed lengthened into a
hundred; but at length they rounded the point
above the mouth of the canal, and saw before them
the Sebastopol of the Rebellion. It was the first
time Frank had ever seen the city, and it was a
sight that he would not have missed for a good
deal. On the heights above the city, and even in
the streets, the little mounds of earth thrown up
showed where rebel cannon were mounted, and
now and then a puff of smoke would rise from
one of these mounds, and a shell would go shrieking
toward the solid lines of the besiegers, which
now completely inclosed the rebels, while an occasional
roar of heavy guns told them that the
iron-clads still kept close watch on the movements
of the enemy below.</p>

<p>The right of the army rested on the river, above
the city, and here the Trenton landed, just out
of range of the batteries. Preparations were at
once made to move some of the guns on shore.
The ones selected were those belonging to Frank's
division, and they were to be mounted in the
batteries above the city, and about a quarter of
a mile from the river. It was something of a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
task to move the battery that distance, but Frank
and his men worked incessantly, and on the second
night the guns were brought to the place
where it was proposed to mount them. The
sailors, although almost exhausted, at once commenced
throwing up a battery; but as soon as
the day dawned, a couple of shells, whistling over
their heads, admonished them that it was time to
cease. After a hearty breakfast on the rations
they had brought with them, the men lay down
in the trenches, and, wearied with their night's
work, slept soundly, in spite of the roar of cannon
and the rattling of musketry that had commenced
as soon as it became light enough for the
combatants to distinguish each other. But life in
the trenches was a new thing to Frank, and he
walked through the rifle-pits, every-where cordially
greeted by the soldiers, who liked the looks
of these big guns, with which they knew he had
something to do, and who made their boasts that,
as soon as the "beauties" were mounted and in
position, they would "square accounts" with the
rebels. There was one gun in particular that
annoyed the soldiers exceedingly, and prevented
them from working on the trenches. Every time a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
shell flew over their heads, they would exclaim,
"Shoot away there, for this is your last day;"
and Frank was obliged to promise, over and over
again, that his first care should be to dismount
that gun.</p>

<p>Frank found that, the further he went, the
nearer the rifle-pits approached to the city; and
finally he came to a group of soldiers who appeared
to be conversing with some invisible persons.
As he approached, he heard a voice,
which seemed to come from the ground, almost
at his side, exclaim:</p>

<p>"I say, Yank, throw over your plug of tobacco,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"Can't see it, Johnny," replied one of the soldiers.
"You wouldn't throw it back again."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will, honor bright," answered the
rebel.</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed Frank, in surprise, "I
didn't know that you had pushed your lines so
close to the enemy's works!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said a lieutenant, who at this moment
came up, "there's a rebel rifle-pit not four feet
from you."</p>

<p>"Here," said a soldier, handing Frank his gun,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
"put your cap on this bayonet and hold it up,
and you'll soon see how far off they are."</p>

<p>Frank did as the soldier suggested. The moment
he raised his cap above the rifle-pit, a bayonet
was suddenly thrust out, and when it was
drawn in, his cap went with it.</p>

<p>"Now, look at that!" exclaimed Frank. "It's
very provoking!"</p>

<p>"Aha, Yank! you're minus that head-piece,"
shouted a voice, which was followed by a roar of
laughter from the rebels, and from all the soldiers
in the rifle-pit who had witnessed the performance.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir," said the soldier. "I did not
want you to lose your cap." Then, raising his
voice, he shouted&mdash;"Johnny, throw that cap back
here!"</p>

<p>"O, no," answered the rebel; "but I'll trade
with you. A fair exchange is no robbery, you
know," and as he spoke a hat came sailing through
the air, and fell into the rifle-pit. It was a very
dilapidated looking affair, bearing unmistakable
proofs of long service and hard usage.</p>

<p>"Say, Yank," continued the rebel, "do you see
a hole in the crown of that hat?"</p>

<p>"Do you call this thing a hat?" asked Frank,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
lifting the article in question on the point of his
sword, and holding it up to the view of the soldiers.
"It bears about as much resemblance to
a hat as it does to a coffee-pot."</p>

<p>"I don't care what you call it," returned the
rebel; "I know it has seen two years' hard service.
That hole you see in the crown was made
by one of your bullets, and my head was in the
hat at the time, too."</p>

<p>"Well, throw me my cap," said Frank; "I
don't want to trade."</p>

<p>"What will you give?"</p>

<p>"We will return your hat, and give you a big
chew of tobacco to boot," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"That's a bargain," said the rebel. "Let's
have it."</p>

<p>"We are not doing a credit business on this
side of the house," answered Frank. "You throw
over my cap first."</p>

<p>"You're sure you don't intend to swindle a
fellow? Upon your honor, now."</p>

<p>"Try me and see," replied Frank, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Here you are, then;" and the missing cap was
thrown into the rifle-pit, and a soldier restored it
to its owner. It was rather the worse for its
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
short sojourn in the rebel hands, for there was a
bayonet hole clear through it.</p>

<p>"Say, you rebel," exclaimed Frank, "why
didn't you tell me that you had stuck a bayonet
into my cap?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't help it, Yank," was the answer.
"Come now, I've filled my part of the contract,
so live up to your promise. Remember, you said
honor bright."</p>

<p>"Well here's your hat," replied Frank; and he
threw the article in question over to its rebel
owner.</p>

<p>"And here's your tobacco, Johnny," chimed
in a soldier, who cut off a huge piece of the weed,
and threw it after the hat.</p>

<p>"Yank, you're a gentleman," said the rebel,
speaking in a thick tone, which showed that the
much coveted article had already found its way
into his mouth. "If I've got any thing you
want, just say so, and you can have it; any thing
except my weapons."</p>

<p>Frank, who was so much amused at what had
just taken place that he laughed until his jaws
ached, returned his mutilated cap to his head,
and, in company with the lieutenant, continued his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
ramble among the rifle-pits, the latter explaining
the operations of the siege, and the various incidents
that had transpired since it commenced.
The rifle-pits, the entire length of General Sherman's
command, were close upon those of the
rebels, and the soldiers of both sides were compelled
to suspend operations almost entirely. If
a man raised his head to select a mark for his
rifle, he would find a rebel, almost within reach,
on the watch for him. The soldiers were very
communicative, and all along the line Frank saw
groups of men holding conversation with their invisible
enemies.</p>

<p>After viewing the works to his satisfaction,
Frank accompanied the lieutenant to his quarters&mdash;a
rude hut, which had been hastily built of
logs and branches, situated in a deep hollow, out
of reach of the enemy's shells. Here he ate an
excellent dinner, and then retraced his steps,
through the rifle-pits, back to the place where his
battery was to be mounted. Throwing himself
upon a blanket, he slept soundly until night.</p>

<p>As soon as it became dark, the work of mounting
the guns commenced, and was completed in
time to allow the weary men two hours' rest before
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
daylight. Frank had charge of one of the guns,
and an ensign attached to one of the iron-clads
commanded the other. The whole was under the
command of the captain of the Trenton. As soon
as the enemy's lines could be discerned, Frank,
in accordance with the promises made the day before,
prepared to commence the work of dismounting
the battery which had given the soldiers so
much trouble. He pointed his gun himself, and
gave the order to fire. With the exception of
now and then a musket-shot, or the occasional
shriek of a shell as it went whistling into the
rebel lines, the night had been remarkably quiet,
and the roar that followed Frank's order awoke
the echoes far and near, causing many a soldier
to start from his blanket in alarm. A shell from
the other gun quickly followed, and the soldiers,
as soon as they learned that the "gun-boat battery"
had opened upon the rebel works, broke
out into deafening cheers. They had great confidence
in the "beauties," as they called the monster
guns, for they had often witnessed the effect
of their shells, and knew that those who worked
them well understood their business. Frank had
opened the ball, and in less than half an hour the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
firing became general all along the line. The gun
against which their fire was directed replied briskly;
but after a few rounds the battery got its exact
range&mdash;an eight-inch shell struck it, and it disappeared
from sight. Cheers, or, rather, regular
"soldier-yells"&mdash;a noise that is different from
every other sound, and which can not be uttered
except by those who have "served their time" in
the army&mdash;arose the whole length of the line, as
the soldiers witnessed the effect of the shot, and
knew that their old enemy would trouble them no
more.</p>

<p>In obedience to the captain's order, the fire of
the battery was then directed toward different
parts of the rebel works. The "beauties" performed
all that the soldiers had expected of them,
for they were well handled, and the huge shells
always went straight to the mark. At dark the
firing ceased, and Frank, tired with his day's work,
ate a hearty supper, and threw himself upon his
blanket to obtain a few moments' rest.</p>

<p>The soldiers from all parts of the line at length
began to crowd into the battery, examining every
part of the guns, and listening to the explanations
given by the old quarter-gunner, who, although
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
almost tired out, was busy cleaning the guns, and
could not think of rest until the battery had been
put in readiness for use on the morrow. At
length a man approached the spot where Frank
was reposing, and, seating himself at his side,
commenced an interesting conversation. Frank
soon learned that his visitor was one of the most
noted scouts in the Union army. He was a tall,
broad-shouldered man, straight as an arrow, and
evidently possessed a great deal of muscular power.
Though ragged and dirty, like his companions,
there was something about him that at once attracted
Frank. His actions were easy and graceful,
and he had an air of refinement, which was
observed by every one with whom he came in
contact. He was serving as a private in his regiment,
and, although frequently urged to accept
a command, always declined, for he despised the
inactivity of camp life, and delighted in any thing
in which there was danger and excitement. It was
hinted that he had seen some hard times during his
career as a scout. At length, when the conversation
began to flag, one of the soldiers asked for a
story, and the scout, after lighting his pipe, settled
back on his elbow, and began as follows:</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<h3>The Scout's Story.</h3>

 <a name="chap_xiii_b" id="chap_xiii_b"></a>
  <img src="images/illo_200.jpg" width="113" height="160" alt="chap_xiii_b" title="" />
</div>
<p>oys, the life of a scout is the most
fascinating, as well as the most
dangerous one that I know of. It
is a responsible one, too, for not unfrequently
the safety and well-being
of the entire army depends upon our
reports. If, while we are roaming about the
enemy's camp, we are deceived in regard to their
numbers and position, and our commanding officer,
judging by our reports, thinks himself able to
surprise and defeat them, and if, upon making
the attack, he finds that he has been misled, we
are responsible; at least that is the way I have
always looked at the matter; and many a time I
have misrepresented cases, and have, no doubt,
been the cause of allowing the rebels to escape,
when they might easily have been beaten, knowing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
that our hot-headed commander would order
an attack, no matter how small the chance for
for success might be.</p>

<p>"Just before we started on the campaign that
resulted in the capture of Fort Donelson, I was
detailed to scout for head-quarters; and one day,
while lying in my tent, heartily wishing that a
move would be made which would put an end to
the lazy life I was compelled to lead, one of the
general's staff-officers entered, accompanied by a
youth, whom he introduced to me as Mr. Henderson,
and informed me that he was to be my
'partner.'</p>

<p>"'He my partner!' I ejaculated. 'Is he a
scout? What does he know about soldiering?'</p>

<p>"The new-comer was rather below the medium
height, very slimly built, with soft, white hands,
that looked as though they had never been accustomed
to hard work, and a smooth, beardless
face. He seemed very much out of place among
our rough soldiers.</p>

<p>"'I don't know much about scouting, that's a
fact,' said he, with a laugh. 'But I know every
inch of the country, and can use a rifle. I have
been knocked about considerably since the war
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
commenced, and my father was hanged in Tennessee
for being a Union man, and I suffered all
sorts of hardships before I succeeded in making
my escape.'</p>

<p>"The officer left us together, and, in spite of
the chagrin I felt that a mere stripling had been
sent to me for an associate, I was soon deeply
interested in him, for with his almost childlike
simplicity there was mingled an air of confidence
in his own powers which drew me irresistibly
toward him. He told me his history, and when
he dwelt on the cruelty with which the rebels had
treated Union men in Tennessee, and related, in
a subdued voice, the particulars of his father's
death, his slight frame quivered with excitement,
and his fingers twitched convulsively, as if he felt
the perpetrators of the deed in his grasp. He
seemed to have the real grit in him, and I finally
came to the conclusion that I had mistaken my
man. I soon learned it was so, for, the very
first time we got on a scout together, I found that
he was made of the right stuff, and I began to
have a great deal of confidence in my youthful
companion. I don't believe he knew what fear
was. He was a splendid shot and an excellent
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
rider; in fact, he seemed to be out of his element
unless he was in the saddle.</p>

<p>"The first time that Sam (for that was my
companion's name) had a chance to show his
qualities was after the battle of Pittsburg Landing.
One night, just after dark, we set out on
horseback to watch the movements of the enemy.
We were dressed in our rebel uniform, and provided
with passes which would carry us through
our lines. The night was dark and cloudy, but
Sam, who knew the road like a book, took the
lead. We had proceeded in this manner about
four miles, scarcely saying a word to each other,
when suddenly, as we came around a bend in the
road, we found ourselves close upon a picket station.
Several men were lying around a fire, eating
their supper; and the reason why we had not
discovered them sooner was on account of the
thick trees and bushes, which completely concealed
the glare of the fire from any one coming down
the road. How we had succeeded in passing the
sentries, which were posted some distance from the
station, is still a mystery to me. Either our advance
had been so still that they had not heard
us, or else the sentries were asleep; at any rate,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
we were in the enemy's lines before we knew it,
and in something of a scrape. If we undertook
to retreat, besides running the risk of being shot
by the men at the fire, we should be obliged to
pass the sentries, and we might not succeed, for
the clatter of our horses' hoofs would certainly
alarm them. The only way was to ride up to the
fire and put a bold face on the matter, which we
did, the rebels supposing that, as we had passed
the sentries, we were all right. They at once
took us for some of their scouts, and one of them
inquired:</p>

<p>"'How are the Yanks?'</p>

<p>"'They're there,' I replied. 'And you'll have
to haul in these picket posts before long, or I am
mistaken.'</p>

<p>"'How is that sentry out there?' asked the
lieutenant in command.</p>

<p>"'O, he's all right,' I answered, and seating
myself at the fire, began to pitch into the eatables.
Sam followed my example, and we enjoyed
a very good meal, after which we smoked a pipe,
and talked with our companions about the probability
of soon thrashing the Yankees soundly, and
wishing that we were in the Eastern army, that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
we might have the honor of carrying the secesh
rag into Philadelphia and all the other large cities
at the North. We also received some very valuable
information in regard to the rebels and their
intended movements; and finally, concluding that
the general must be looking for us, we bade the
pickets good-by, mounted our horses, and galloped
down the road toward the rebel camp. As soon
as we thought we had gone far enough to deceive
the pickets, we turned off from the road and
started through the woods, intending to take a
wide circuit, pass the pickets, and start back for
our own camp. We stumbled about through the
woods for nearly an hour, and finally struck a
road that appeared to run at right angles with
the one we had just left. This we followed at a
rapid gallop for about a mile, when Sam pointed
out a light that appeared to be shining in the
window of a house ahead of us. We at once determined
to reconnoiter, and rode slowly forward
for that purpose, walking our horses on the grass
at the side of the road, so that our advance would
be noiseless. We had gone but a short distance
when we were halted. To the challenge, 'Who
comes there?' Sam replied, 'Scouts,' and throwing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
me his rein, he swung himself from his saddle,
whispering:</p>

<p>"'Hold on a minute, Bill! Let me manage
that fellow;' and before I could say a word he
had disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Several moments passed, when I again heard
his voice, and riding forward, wondering how he
had 'managed' the sentinel, I was surprised to
see him with a musket in his hand, pacing back
and forth across the road. I instantly understood
what had transpired, and leading the horses cautiously
into the bushes at the side of the road, I
fastened them there, and then returned to Sam.</p>

<p>"'I couldn't help it, Bill,' he whispered, as I
came up. 'I meant to capture him, and compel
him to give us some information; but he fought
so desperately that I had to settle him to save
myself.'</p>

<p>"'It can't be helped; such things are not uncommon
in war times. Now you play the part
of sentry here until some one passes, and you can
find out what the countersign is. Then I'll go
up to the house and reconnoiter.'</p>

<p>"I then lay down by the side of the road, and
in a few moments Sam whispered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Bill, I wonder what's the number of this
post?'</p>

<p>"'I'm sure I don't know,' I replied.</p>

<p>"'Well, how am I going to find out?' he inquired.
'If some one should happen to come
along without the countersign, and I should want
to call the corporal, I would be in a nice fix,
wouldn't I?'</p>

<p>"Sam said this in such a perfectly cool and
unconcerned manner, that I could not help admiring
him.</p>

<p>"Just then I heard a faint shout:</p>

<p>"'Twelve o'clock! Number one. All's well.'</p>

<p>"'There,' I whispered; 'the sentries are passing
the call. Now look sharp.'</p>

<p>"The call passed the round of the sentinels,
until number eight was called, but a short distance
from us. Then came a pause.</p>

<p>"'Sam, you're number nine,' I hurriedly whispered.</p>

<p>"'Number nine; and all's well!' shouted Sam
at the top of his lungs. 'So far, so good,' he
continued, in a low voice. 'Now I guess we're
all right. Halt!' he shouted, hearing the sound
of horses' hoofs rapidly advancing. The horseman
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
at once drew rein, and at Sam's challenge,
answered:</p>

<p>"'Colonel Peckham.'</p>

<p>"'Dismount, Colonel Peckham, and give the
countersign.'</p>

<p>"'Look here, my man, just let me pass, will
you? Don't detain me, for I am on important
business, and am in a great hurry.'</p>

<p>"'Halt,' shouted Sam again; 'dismount.'</p>

<p>"'I tell you I am Colonel Peckham, commanding&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'I don't care what you command. Just
climb down off that horse instantly, or I'll fire on
you. You shouldn't go by me if you were President
Davis himself.'</p>

<p>"The colonel, seeing that entreaty was in vain,
reluctantly dismounted and gave the countersign,
'Virginia.'</p>

<p>"'The countersign is correct. Pass, Colonel
Peckham,' said Sam, bringing his musket promptly
to a shoulder arms.</p>

<p>"After the rebel had mounted and disappeared,
I whispered:</p>

<p>"'Now, Sam, I'm going up to that house.
Keep a sharp look-out.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"After shaking his hand I started toward the
place where I had seen the light. Walking carelessly
up toward a group of soldiers who were
lounging about on the ground, I glanced in at the
window, and saw several officers seated around a
table, apparently engaged in earnest debate. I
listened for a few moments to the conversation of
the men, and found that I was two miles inside of
the rebel lines. This knowledge was something
that would not have pleased me had I been alone,
for I was wholly unacquainted with the country,
but, knowing that I had a friend on whom I could
rely, I looked upon it as merely a little difficulty,
from which I could extricate myself as soon and
as easily as I pleased.</p>

<p>"I lounged about, picking up a good deal of
information, until I heard the relief called, and
knowing that, unless we beat a hasty retreat, we
would be discovered, I hastened back to the place
where I had left Sam, and found him industriously
pacing his beat. I was about to bring out the
horses, when we heard the clatter of hoofs coming
up the road from toward the house, and I at once
concealed myself. The answer to the challenge
was Colonel Peckham, who was returning to his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
command. As he was about to pass, I, thinking
that it would not look well to go back to the camp
empty-handed, sprang out of my concealment and
seized his reins, while Sam, who instantly comprehended
what was going on, placed his bayonet
against his breast.</p>

<p>"'What means this?' asked the colonel.</p>

<p>"'Don't talk so much,' replied Sam. 'A blind
man could see that you are a prisoner. So hand
over your weapons, and don't make any fuss.'</p>

<p>"As Sam spoke, he proceeded to 'sound' the
colonel, and the search resulted in the transfer of
two revolvers to his belt. Then, throwing away
his musket and cartridge-box, he sprang upon his
horse, which I had by this time brought out, and,
seizing the colonel's reins, we started down the
road at a full gallop.</p>

<p>"We had proceeded scarcely a quarter of a mile
when we heard several musket-shots behind us,
and we knew that the relief had found No. 9 post
vacant, and were alarming the camp. Sam, still
holding fast to the colonel's horse, at once turned
off into the woods, through which we with difficulty
worked our way. At length, however, we
reached an open field, which we crossed at a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
gallop, and, leaping our horses over the fence,
found ourselves in the road again. We had
struck it just outside of the rebel pickets, who,
hearing us gallop away, fired at us; but the bullets
all went wide of the mark, and in less than an
hour we reached our own camp, and the prisoner
was delivered over to the general."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I could relate many other adventures to you,
but, as I have to go on guard at midnight, I must
bid you good-night."</p>

<p>So saying, he arose from the ground, where he
had been lying, and walked off toward his quarters.
One by one the soldiers, who had gathered
about to listen to his story, followed his example,
and finally Frank and the ensign who had assisted
him in managing the battery, were left alone. Although
they had been together but two days, they
were on excellent terms with each other; and as
Frank had learned that his companion had run
by the batteries at Vicksburg, he was naturally
anxious to hear the details. The ensign, at his
urgent solicitation, then told the story of his
thrilling adventures, which here follows.</p>

<h3>Running the Batteries.</h3>

</div>
<p>n obedience to orders from the admiral,"
began the ensign, "the Concord,
with the iron-clads, commenced making
preparations to run the batteries, by
greasing the casemates to glance shot,
and by protecting the machinery with
heavy timbers and bales of hay. When
every thing was ready, the long-looked-for signal
was made. The vessels took their stations in accordance
with a general order that had been issued
a few days previous&mdash;the Concord, with a coal-barge
in tow, being the fourth in advance.</p>

<p>"As soon as the anchors were weighed, all
hands were called to quarters, the ports closed,
and every light on board the ship, except those in
the magazine and shell-rooms, was extinguished.
I took my station beside my men, who stood at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
their guns as motionless as so many statues, and
in that darkness awaited the issue of events, with
feelings that can not be described. The moment
I had so long been dreading was fast approaching.
Would I survive the experiment?</p>

<p>"As soon as the vessels were fairly under way,
the engines were stopped, and we drifted along
with the current. Not a sound was heard, except
the creaking of the wheel as the pilot guided the
vessel down stream. I became more and more
excited each moment, until finally my suspense
seemed greater than I could bear. That awful
silence was worse than the fight itself. I became
impatient, and strode up and down the deck, anxiously
waiting for the first roar of a gun that
should announce that our approach had been discovered.
How I longed to look out and see what
progress we were making! But the ports had been
closed, with imperative orders that they must not
be opened without the captain's command, and I
was obliged to remain in ignorance of what was
going on outside.</p>

<p>"At length, after remaining at our quarters
for nearly an hour&mdash;to me it seemed an age&mdash;the
loud roar of a gun burst upon our ears. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
pilot at once rang the bell to 'go ahead strong,'
and the puffing of the engines told us that we
were rapidly nearing the city. Soon, from another
direction, came a second report, accompanied
by a shell from 'Whistling Dick,' which went
directly over our heads, and exploded far behind
us. This was followed, not by the report of a
single cannon, but by a crash, as if all the artillery
of heaven had been let loose at once, and
shells and solid shot, with a noise that was almost
deafening. It did not seem possible that we
could succeed in running by the batteries; besides,
I was very much averse to being shut up
in that manner, without the privilege of returning
shot for shot. The idea of allowing my vessel
to be made a target of, when so many brave hearts
were waiting impatiently to give as good as they
received, did not at all suit me.</p>

<p>"Until we reached the city, the Concord escaped
unhurt, and I began to think that our danger
was not so great as I had at first supposed,
when, just as we arrived opposite the upper batteries,
a shot came crashing through the sides of
the vessel. The deck was lighted up for an instant
with a flash, and the groans and shrieks
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
that followed told that it had been too well directed.
Confined as the men were, in total darkness,
where it was impossible for a person to
distinguish those who stood next to him, such an
occurrence was well calculated to throw them into
confusion. I believe that every one on deck was
frightened, but the order, 'Stand to your guns,
lads!' delivered in a firm voice by the executive
officer, at once put an end to the confusion.</p>

<p>"'On deck, there!' came thundering through
the trumpet. 'Open the ports, and return their
fire!'</p>

<p>"How my heart bounded when I heard that
order! And the men, too, anxious to be on more
equal terms with the enemy, sprang at the word,
the port-shutters flew open with a crash, and the
city of Vicksburg burst upon our astonished
view.</p>

<p>"The rebels had profited by their experience,
and instead of finding the city shrouded in total
darkness, as I had expected, a glare equal to the
noonday sun lighted up both the river and the
city, the latter seeming one blaze of fire. The
vessels in advance of us were rapidly answering
the fire of the batteries, and the waters of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
river, usually so quiet and smooth, were plowed
in every direction by the shrieking, hissing shells.
It was a magnificent sight, one upon which I
could have gazed with rapture, had I been a disinterested
person; but, as it was, I had no time
to dwell upon it.</p>

<p>"'Out with those guns&mdash;lively!' shouted the
captain. 'Give the rascals as good as they send.'</p>

<p>"For half an hour the fight continued, the
rebels sending their shells thick and fast about
our devoted vessel, and we directing our fire
against the water-batteries, which lined the shore
as far as the eye could reach, when suddenly the
pilot rung the bell to stop, which was followed
by a command shouted down through the trumpet
to 'Back her&mdash;quick!' I scarcely noticed the
circumstance, until one of my men exclaimed, in
a frightened voice, 'We are drifting into the bank,
sir, right under the batteries!'</p>

<p>"The appalling fact was too evident. We were
fast approaching the shore, and the engines appeared
to be working in vain against the strong
current. A cry of horror burst from the lips of
the men, who deserted their guns, and made a
general rush for the after part of the vessel. I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
was astounded. Had the Concord been disabled,
and was the captain about to run her ashore and
surrender? But I was not allowed much time to
ask questions. The conduct of the men recalled
me to my senses, and, after considerable difficulty,
I succeeded in bringing them all back to their
quarters.</p>

<p>"'The vessel must have been surrendered, sir,'
said one of the men.</p>

<p>"'I can't help that. I've received no orders
to cease firing. Let them have it. Powder-boy,
bring two eight-inch canister as soon as possible.
Run away lively, now.'</p>

<p>"The vessel still continued to approach the
bank, and several of the nearest batteries ceased
firing, while the rebels, supposing that she was
about to surrender, came running down the bank
in crowds, calling out:</p>

<p>"'Have you struck your flag?'</p>

<p>"'No!' came the answer, in a clear, ringing
voice, which I knew belonged to the captain.
'That flag floats as long as one plank of this
vessel remains above water!'</p>

<p>"This reply was followed by a shell from one
of our broadside guns, which burst in the very
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
midst of a crowd that was preparing to board
the vessel the moment we touched the bank; and
by this time the Concord began to mind her
helm, and commenced moving from the bank.
The astonished rebels hastily retreated to the
cover of their breastworks, and I succeeded in
getting my guns loaded in time to use the canister
upon them. The vessel soon got headed down
the river again, and at two o'clock in the morning
we rounded to, out of reach of the batteries. The
passage had been effected without material damage
to us, and it was with a light heart that I
repeated the order, 'Secure your guns, lads!'
The battle was over, and after the decks had been
cleared, and the wounded taken care of, the dead
were laid out in the engine-room, and covered
with the flag in defense of which they had delivered
up their lives. The weary sailors then
gladly answered to the order, 'All hands stand
by your hammocks,' and I retired to my room
almost exhausted, but highly elated at our glorious
success."</p>

<h3>A Race for the Old Flag.</h3>

</div>
<p>he next day," continued the ensign,
"the squadron again got under
way and steamed down the river,
and came to anchor above, and almost
within range of, the heights of Grand
Gulf. A casual observer would hardly
have thought that the bluffs which arose
so majestically, like grim sentinels watching over
the lesser heights around them, were bristling with
hostile batteries, ready to dispute the further advance
of the Union fleet; for, so carefully had
they been concealed, that nothing suspicious
could be discovered. But we were not deceived.
We knew that the trees which covered the bluffs,
and waved so gently back and forth in the
breeze, concealed fortifications of the most formidable
kind, and that Union blood must be shed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
before they could be wrested from the traitorous
hands that had constructed them.</p>

<p>"During the week of inactivity that followed,
many an impatient eye was directed toward the
heights which, now so quiet, were soon to be disturbed
by the noise and confusion of battle. At
length the flag-ship was seen approaching, and
every one was on the alert. Two more days of
inactivity passed, however; but on the third morning,
just after the crews had finished their breakfast,
signal was made to commence the attack.
The anchors were weighed, the men called to
quarters, and the fleet bore down upon the rebel
stronghold, which was soon enveloped in the
smoke of battle.</p>

<p>"The Concord led the advance. For two hours
the battle raged with great fury on both sides,
the rebels stubbornly holding their ground, in
spite of the storm of shells that thinned their
ranks and tore up the ground about them. During
this time the Concord had again become unmanageable,
on account of the strong eddies in
the river, and had worked into a position scarcely
two hundred yards from the batteries, from which
she could not be extricated. It was impossible
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
either to advance or retreat without running into
the bank, and if she attempted to round-to, her
destruction was certain. Of course, we below,
being busy fighting our guns, knew nothing of our
danger; but the captain, although as brave a man
as ever trod a ship's deck, was not a little dismayed
when he found himself in this perilous
situation. He did not expect to bring his vessel
safely out of the action, but he stood in the pilot-house
and issued his orders with as much coolness
as though he were going through the regular
daily exercise, instead of being under the hottest
fire the enemy could rain upon his vessel.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, I had been sending my
shells as rapidly as possible toward the rebel
gunners, whom I could see moving about in the
batteries. Up to this time not one of my men
had been injured; but, just as I was in the act
of sighting one of my guns, there was a stunning
crash, and a vivid light shone for an instant in my
eyes, accompanied by a terrific explosion. I saw
the air filled with smoke and splinters, heard appalling
cries of terror and anguish, and then all
was blank. A shell had entered the casemate
above the port, killing and wounding several of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
my crew, and a piece of heavy timber, which had
been detached from the bulk-head by the explosion,
struck me on the head, and laid me out
senseless on the deck.</p>

<p>"When I was restored to consciousness I was
lying on a mattress in the engine-room, and anxious
faces were bending over me. I remember of
mistaking the doctor and his attendants for the
men belonging to my gun's crew, and imagining
myself still in battle, I gave the order to 'Train
that No. 2 gun a little further to the left, and
fire;' then I became insensible again.</p>

<p>"About the middle of the afternoon I awoke
from a refreshing slumber, but, of course, could
not imagine how I came to be in that situation. I
felt of my head, which was covered with bandages,
and of my arm, which was done up in a sling, and
finally the remembrance of the scenes through
which I had passed came back to me like a
dream.</p>

<p>"While I was wondering how the fight had
terminated, and who had come out victorious, a
sailor, who had been appointed to act as my nurse,
entered the engine-room, and approached the bed
on tip-toe. From him I learned that the Concord
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
had been under fire for five hours and thirty-five
minutes; that we had been only partially successful,
not having silenced all the batteries; that
the fleet, with the exception of one vessel, which
was lying a short distance above the bluff, and
occasionally sending a shell into the batteries to
prevent the rebels from repairing the damage
which they had suffered, were at their old anchorage
again; that the Concord had been struck
thirty-five times by heavy shot, but, although
quite badly cut up, was not permanently injured;
and that our vessel would soon be ready
for action again, the entire crew being busily
engaged in repairing the damages she had sustained.</p>

<p>"My head and arm pained me considerably;
but, being under the influence of some powerful
medicine which the doctor had administered, I soon
fell asleep, from which I was awakened by the
rolling of a drum. Hastily starting up, I found the
engineers at their stations, and I knew, by the
tramping of feet on the deck above me, that the
men were hurrying to their quarters. The 'ruling
passion' was strong with me. I had grown
so accustomed to yield prompt obedience to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
call to quarters, that I quite forgot I was wounded.
Springing up, I at once pulled on my clothes&mdash;an
operation which I found rather difficult on account
of my wounded arm&mdash;seized my sword, which lay
at the head of the bed, sprang up the stairs that
led to the main-deck, and ran forward to take
command of my division. As I passed the door
of the dispensatory, I was confronted by the surgeon,
who, holding up his hands in dismay, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"'Mr. Morton! Do you know what you are
about? Where are you going?'</p>

<p>"'Going to quarters, doctor. Didn't you hear
that drum?'</p>

<p>"'Get below, sir, instantly,' was the doctor's
answer. 'Get below! and don't let me catch
you on deck again until I give you permission.
Get below, I tell you, sir!' he continued, in a
louder tone, seeing that I hesitated. 'Haven't
you got sense enough to know that you are dangerously
wounded? I am surgeon of this ship,
and have authority to enforce my commands.'</p>

<p>"Of this I was well aware, and I was obliged to
retrace my steps to the engine-room, where I lay
down upon the bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>"The morning's fight having convinced the admiral
that, although the batteries had been partially
silenced, they could not be completely
reduced, without the co-operation of the land
forces, he returned to his old anchorage, for the
purpose of convoying the transports which were
to run by the batteries and ferry the troops across
the river below. The latter followed close in the
wake of the gun-boats, on which the batteries
opened quite as briskly as in the morning. The
iron-clads replied, and under cover of their fire
the transports passed the batteries in safety, after
which the gun-boats also ran by, and assisted in
carrying the troops across the river. In this fight
the Concord was struck but twice, and no one was
injured. As soon as she had been brought to an
anchor, the doctor entered the engine-room, and,
after regarding me for a moment with an expression
that I could not understand, said:</p>

<p>"'You're a nice one, ain't you?'</p>

<p>"'Why, doctor, what's the matter?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'You don't wish to get well, I guess.'</p>

<p>"'O, yes, I do! But I am not badly hurt; there
was nothing to hinder me from taking my station.'</p>

<p>"'You will allow me to be the judge of that, if
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
you please,' returned the doctor. 'But I have
got a room fixed up for you on deck. Do you
feel able to walk up there?'</p>

<p>"'Certainly. I am not hurt, I tell you, doctor,'
I repeated. 'I can outrun, outjump, or outlift
you; and yet you take as much care of me as
though I was badly wounded.'</p>

<p>"'Well, you've got a big hole in your head anyhow,'
said the doctor, as he took my arm, and
assisted me up the stairs, in spite of my assertions
that I was 'able to walk alone.' 'It's an
ugly-looking wound. Just take my advice now;
let me put you on the sick-list for a day or two,
and you will be all right.'</p>

<p>"'Well, don't keep me on the list any longer
than is necessary,' I answered, knowing that I
would be compelled to submit to the doctor's requirements,
whether I wanted to or not. 'I do
detest a life of inactivity. I want to be doing
something.'</p>

<p>"I was furnished with a bed in the ward-room,
for my own quarters had been almost demolished
during the late fights, and during the two days
that followed, I passed the time miserably enough.
Every able-bodied man on board the ship was engaged
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
in repairing damages, while I, being closely
watched by the doctor, was obliged to remain
quiet. My wounds troubled me very little. On
the third day after the fight, to my immense relief,
my name was taken off the sick-list, and I
was allowed to return to duty.</p>

<p>"The next morning after this, signal was made
from the flag-ship to get under way, and resume
the attack upon the batteries at Grand Gulf. As
we approached the heights, a column of smoke,
which was seen arising over the trees, told us
that the rebels had abandoned their fortifications.
The gun-boats touched the bank at the foot of
the hill at about the same moment; and, as the
Concord's bows touched the shore, the captain
thrust his head from the pilot-house, and shouted:</p>

<p>"'Get ashore there, you sea-cooks! Get ashore
there, and hoist the Concord's flag over that fort
on the top of the hill! Off you go&mdash;run like
quarter horses!'</p>

<p>"The sailors did not need a second bidding, but,
leaving their quarters, they made a general rush
for the place where the boat-ensigns were stowed,
and if one of the men succeeded in securing a
flag, he was instantly seized by half a dozen
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
others, who desperately struggled to wrest it from
him, that they might have the honor of planting
it upon the rebel heights, while he struggled as
furiously to retain it. All discipline was at an
end. The sailors, wild with excitement, were
struggling and shouting below, while the captain
stood on the quarter-deck, almost beside himself,
for fear that his men would be behind, for the
crews of each vessel were jumping ashore, bearing
in their hands the flags which they had determined
to plant upon the deserted fortifications.</p>

<p>"I stood at the hatchway, looking down upon
the struggling crew beneath, regretting that my
wounded arm&mdash;which still continued to pain me at
intervals&mdash;prevented me from entering as a competitor,
when I was aroused by:</p>

<p>"'Mr. Morton! I know you want this, sir.'</p>

<p>"I turned, and found one of the quarter-masters
holding out a flag to me.</p>

<p>"'Certainly I want it,' I answered. 'Thank
you;' and seizing the flag, I sprang upon the hammock-nettings.
At this moment the doctor discovered
me, and shouted:</p>

<p>"'Mr. Morton, what are you about, sir? Remember,
I only put you on light duty. It will
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
be the death of you, if you attempt to run up
that hill.'</p>

<p>"But I was excited, and, without waiting to answer,
sprang overboard. I was so anxious to be
first, that I could not waste time to go below, and
leave the ship in a proper manner. The moment
I touched the water, I struck out for the shore,
and as I clambered up the bank, I found crowds
of men from each vessel running at the top of
their speed toward the hill, all bent on planting
the glorious old flag on the pinnacle, for the possession
of which they had fought so long and
desperately. But far in advance of all of them
I saw one of the engineers of the Concord. I
was both pleased and annoyed at this&mdash;pleased
that the ship to which I belonged should have the
honor of hoisting the Stars and Stripes over the
rebel stronghold, and annoyed that I could not
be the person who was to raise it. But it was
not my disposition to be discouraged. As I had
few equals in running, I determined to overtake
the engineer, and, if possible, to beat him.</p>

<p>"As soon as I reached the top of the bank, I
commenced running, and was soon ahead of many
of those who were far in advance of me when I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
started. The engineer, in the mean time, also
proved that he was no mean runner; and the little
flag which he carried over his shoulder moved
far up the mountain, dancing about among the
rocks and bushes like a will-o'-the-wisp, seeming
to recede as I advanced. Soon I had passed all
of my competitors with the exception of this one,
and the race was now between us. Up, up we
ran. I soon discovered that I was gaining at
every step. Presently I was so close to him that
I could hear his quick, heavy breathing. We
were rapidly nearing the fort that crowned the
crest of the hill, and I redoubled my exertions.
The engineer did likewise. It seemed as though
the sight of those battered fortifications had infused
new life into him, for he ran at a rate that
astonished me; and when I reached the top of
the hill the little banner had been planted on the
breastworks, and my rival lay on the ground,
panting and exhausted. Cheers, long and loud,
burst from the gallant band standing at the foot
of the hill, who had been interested spectators of
our movements, and their shouts were answered
with redoubled energy by the crew of the Concord,
who, in their joy at seeing their own flag
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
planted on the fort by one of their own officers,
forgot all the sacrifices they had made to accomplish
that end.</p>

<p>"In a short time the heights were covered with
men, who busied themselves in completing the destruction
which the rebels had commenced. At
dark all returned on board their respective vessels,
which moved out into the stream a short distance,
and anchored. I paid dearly for my foolishness
in jumping overboard, and then running that distance
in the hot sun; for two days after that I
was confined to my bed, and finally, at the doctor's
suggestion, I was dumped into an ambulance
and sent by land to the hospital-ship. I was well
again in two weeks, and learning that a naval
battery was to be mounted on shore, volunteered
to assist in working it, received permission, and
am ready to face any new dangers for the sake
of the old flag."</p>

<p>The next day, while Frank and his companion
were fighting the battery, the former was surprised
by the appearance of a strange officer, who
brought orders for him to report on board his
vessel without delay. He obeyed the summons,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
and found that the Trenton had been ordered up
the Yazoo River, and that he had been sent for
to take charge of a division whose commanding
officer had been sent to the hospital. As soon as
he arrived on board, the vessel was got under
way, and, in company with the flag-ship and several
gun-boats, which they found waiting for them
at the mouth of the Yazoo River, they started
toward Haines' Bluff. The report was, the attack
was to be a 'feigned' one, but Frank thought,
from the pounding the Trenton received, that it
might as well have been a <i>real</i> one.</p>

<p>The fight was continued until dark, when the
vessels dropped down out of range of the batteries
and anchored.</p>

<h3>The Rival Sharp-Shooters.</h3>

</div>
<p>bout half-past four o'clock, on
the succeeding morning, just after
Frank had come off watch, and was
dozing in his berth, he was awakened
by a loud crash. Starting up, he
discovered his looking-glass in fragments,
and the pieces scattered about
over the floor. While he was wondering what
could have been the cause of the accident, he
happened to discover that the bulk-head behind
the looking-glass was splintered, which looked
very much as though it had been done by a
musket-shot; and, at the same instant, he heard
a shrill whistle, with which he was perfectly familiar.
He also heard a rustling in the bunk
above him, and Mr. Williams, his room-mate,
sprang suddenly upon the floor, exclaiming:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"My goodness, Mr. Nelson! the rebels are
shooting at <i>us</i>."</p>

<p>"I see they are," answered Frank, coolly, as
he slowly arose from his berth and commenced
drawing on his pants; "just see our looking-glass!
But where are you going?" he asked,
finding that his room-mate was frantically gathering
up his clothing.</p>

<p>"I'm going to get below as soon as I can,"
was the answer. "Don't you know that this
room isn't iron-clad?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that. But what's your hurry?"</p>

<p>Mr. Williams did not stop to reply, but, having
collected all his clothing, opened the door and
sprang out on deck. One bound carried him to
the gangway that led to the main-deck, and in a
moment more he had disappeared. Frank was
laughing heartily at the comical figure his timid
room-mate had cut, when another shot came
crashing through the bulk-head, and lodged in the
mattress in the berth above him, showing how
narrow had been Mr. Williams's escape. This
made him think that he also had better be getting
below. He waited, however, until he was entirely
dressed, and then walked slowly out on the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
quarter-deck, and took refuge behind the wheel-house,
intending to make himself acquainted with
the nature of the attack before going below. The
officer of the deck and the quarter-master on
watch were the only persons in sight, and they,
too, were standing behind the wheel-house for
protection.</p>

<p>"What seems to be the matter, Mr. Martin?
Are we likely to have a brush?"</p>

<p>"O no," answered the latter; "a few rebels
have taken possession of the battery from which
we drove them yesterday, and are trying to pick
some of us off. Did you see 'Nuisance' when he
came out of his room? He ran like a streak, but
came very near being winged, for a ball struck
the deck not six inches from him."</p>

<p>At this moment the captain appeared, and went
into the pilot-house, that he might investigate matters
without running the risk of being struck by
the bullets. He had scarcely closed the door,
when a ball carried away the latch. Had he been
a moment later, he would certainly have been killed.</p>

<p>"A close shave," said he, with a laugh. Then
raising one of the windows of the pilot-house, he
shouted, "On deck, there!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," answered Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>"Get under cover as quickly as possible; and,
Mr. Nelson, see if you can throw a few shells
among those fellows, and drive them out of there."</p>

<p>It was not an easy task to get under cover, for,
the moment they showed themselves, the bullets
whistled about them like hail-stones. But, after
dodging from one stanchion to another, using even
the sky-lights for concealment, they succeeded
in reaching the main-deck, where they were safe.
Frank ran into the turret, while Mr. Martin and
the quarter-master dived down the hatchway, and
ran up into the pilot-house.</p>

<p>"Turn out, you first division, and cast loose
that No. 2 gun," shouted Frank, as he reached
the gun-deck, where the crew were still sleeping
soundly in their hammocks. "Turn out lively,
lads."</p>

<p>The men at once sprang out of their comfortable
beds, and, as soon as the deck was cleared of the
hammocks, the gun was cast loose. A moment
afterward, a hundred-pound shot plunged into the
battery, raising a cloud of dust; but the rebels
had seen the flash of the gun in time to throw
themselves behind the embankment and escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>"On deck, there," shouted the captain, through
the trumpet. "That was very well done. Try
them again, and fire a little higher, and a trifle
further to the left."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," shouted Frank, in reply; and
the gun was again pointed, and another breach
was made in the battery, but a loud, derisive shout
was sent back in reply, showing that the shot had
been without effect.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour the fight was kept up,
Frank using his gun as rapidly as possible, and
the rebels replying with their bullets, which rattled
harmlessly against the Trenton's iron mail,
until the captain, finding that it was impossible to
dislodge them, gave the order to cease firing.</p>

<p>As soon as Frank had seen the gun secured, he
left the deck and went into the ward-room. It was
filled with officers, who had been awakened by the
firing, and were engaged in an animated conversation
on the probabilities of having breakfast.</p>

<p>"If the rebels continue to shoot at us, I don't
know what you can do, gentlemen," said the caterer.
"You know that the galley is on deck, and
I can't send the cook up there, where he will be in
danger of his life. When you get hungry you
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
will find plenty of hard-tack and pickles in the
paymaster's store-rooms."</p>

<p>"O no," said the executive officer, "I am not
going without my breakfast. There's no danger."</p>

<p>"If you will go on deck, and remain there five
minutes," said the caterer, "I'll agree to cook
some breakfast for you."</p>

<p>The proposition was accepted by the executive
officer, and the two men went on deck, and walked
toward the galley. They reached it in safety,
when the executive said, triumphantly:</p>

<p>"What do you think now? I told you there
was no danger."</p>

<p>A loud crash cut short his words, and a bullet
entered the galley, and glancing from the stove,
struck the opposite bulk-head, where it remained
firmly embedded in the wood.</p>

<p>"That will do, I guess," said the executive,
hastily retreating toward the hatchway. "You
needn't mind about sending the boys up here to
cook breakfast."</p>

<p>The two officers made the best of their way
back to the ward-room, where they enjoyed a very
good meal on some provisions that had been
brought up out of the paymaster's store-rooms.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
They then went into the pilot-house to watch the
movements of the rebels in the battery. The latter,
finding that their fire was no longer returned,
took no precautions to conceal themselves, but
arose to their full height when they fired their
muskets, and even stood on the battery, waving
their hats, as if inviting a shot. Frank watched
them until he could stand it no longer, and then
ran down below, to ask the captain's permission to
return the fire.</p>

<p>"Look out there!" exclaimed that gentleman,
as Frank entered the cabin. "The first thing
you know"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the report of a musket,
so loud that it seemed scarcely a stone's throw
distant. A bullet came whistling into one of the
ports, barely missing Frank, and lodged in the captain's
pantry, where a crashing among the crockery
told that the ball had not been altogether thrown
away. Another shot followed close after it, but
Frank had dodged behind the bulk-head, and was
safe.</p>

<p>The captain was emphatically in a state of
siege. His cabin was in the extreme after-part
of the vessel, and in it were two port-holes, which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
were open. Two sharp-shooters had taken up a
position on the bank, where they could see into
the cabin, and had compelled the captain to leave
the desk where he had been writing, and take
refuge behind the bulk-head. He was taking matters
very coolly, however, being stretched out on
a sofa, engaged in reading a newspaper.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nelson," said he, with a laugh, "if
many more of you officers enter this cabin, I shall
be a ruined man. Every shot that comes in here
goes slap into that pantry, and I don't suppose I
have a whole piece of crockery left. What did
you wish?"</p>

<p>"I came, sir, to ask permission to take one of
your Spencer rifles," answered Frank. "I believe
I can drive those rascals away from there,"
he added, glancing through the port.</p>

<p>"Very well, you may try. But I don't bother
my head about them. They can't shoot through
this bulk head, that's certain. However, it makes
me feel rather uncomfortable to know that I can't
get out of here without running the risk of being
shot;" and the captain stretched himself on the
sofa again, and resumed his reading.</p>

<p>After considerable dodging, during which two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
more bullets were lodged in the captain's pantry, to
the no small disgust of that gentleman, Frank succeeded
in securing a rifle and cartridge-box from
one of the racks in the cabin, and concealing himself
behind the bulk-head, thrust his gun carefully
out of the port, and waited for a shot.</p>

<p>The bank was scarcely fifty feet distant, but
for a long time not a rebel showed himself, and
Frank had about come to the conclusion that they
had given up the fight, when he noticed a small
gully, scarcely a foot wide, that ran down to the
water's edge, and in that gully he saw the top
of a head, and afterward discerned a pair of eyes
that were looking straight into the port. It was
a small mark to shoot at, but Frank had killed
squirrels at that distance many a time; so, carefully
raising his rifle, he took a quick aim, and
fired, confident that there was one rebel less in
the world. The ball landed in the bank, and
raised a cloud of dust that for a moment concealed
the effect of the shot; but it had scarcely cleared
away, when a puff of smoke arose from the gully,
and another bullet whizzed past Frank's head, and
landed among the captain's crockery, showing that
the rebel still maintained his position. Frank
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
cautiously looked out, and saw the rebel hastily
reloading his gun; but, before he could give him
another shot, the deadly rifle was thrust over the
bank, in readiness for another trial.</p>

<p>"O, I'm here yet, Yank!" shouted the rebel,
as he saw Frank regarding him as if he could
scarcely believe his eyes. "I'm here! and you
want to keep close, or down comes your meat-house.
This 'ere rifle shoots right smart."</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking, Frank again fired at
him, but with no better success than before, for
the rebel answered the shot, and dodged back into
the gully to reload. For two hours this singular
contest was maintained, and Frank was both astonished
and provoked at his poor workmanship;
still he would have continued the fight, had not the
rebel coolly announced&mdash;"It's grub-time, Yank.
We'll try it again this afternoon."</p>

<p>The fellow's impudence was a source of a great
deal of merriment on the part of the captain, who
laughed heartily at his remarks, and forgot the
loss he had sustained in his crockery.</p>

<p>"Captain," said Frank, as soon as he was certain
that the rebel had gone, "it's a good time to
close those ports now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't go near them. I won't trust the villains.
Tell the officers that they are at liberty
to return the fire, but that they must not waste
too much ammunition."</p>

<p>Frank went into the ward-room, and, after delivering
the captain's order, deposited his gun in
the corner. While making a hearty dinner on
hard-tack and salt pork, he related the incidents
of his fight with the rebel, which was listened to
with interest by all the officers present. After
finishing his meal he went on deck to get a letter
which he had commenced writing to his cousin,
intending, as soon as the firing recommenced, to
renew the battle. Not a shot had been fired
since the rebel left the gully, and when Frank
walked across the deck and entered his room, not
a rebel was in sight. He took the letter from
his trunk, and was preparing to return below,
when a bullet crashed through the bulk-head, and,
striking his wash-bowl, shivered it into fragments.
This seemed to be a signal for a renewal of the
fight, for the bullets whistled over the ship in a
perfect shower. Frank sprang to his feet, and
waited rather impatiently for an opportunity to
make his way below; but none offered. As he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
opened the door of his room, he heard a sharp
report, that he could easily distinguish from the
rest, accompanied by a familiar whistle, and a
bullet, which seemed to come from the stern of
the vessel, sped past him, striking the pilot-house,
and glancing upward with a loud shriek; at the
same instant several more from the battery whistled
by, too close for comfort.</p>

<p>It was evident that the rebels had seen him
enter his room, and knowing that his only chance
for escape was across the deck, had determined to
keep him a close prisoner. But why did they not
fire through the bulk-head? Perhaps they thought
that it, like the rest of the ship, was iron-clad,
and preferred waiting for him to come out, rather
than to waste their lead. But Frank, who knew
that the sides of his room were only thin boards,
which could afford him no protection whatever
from the bullets of his enemies, was not blessed
with the most comfortable thoughts. To go out
was almost certain death, for, although he might
escape the bullets of the rebels in the battery,
there was his rival of the morning in the gully,
who handled his rifle with remarkable skill. To
remain was hardly less dangerous, for a bullet
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
might at any time enter his room and put an end
to his existence.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm in a nice fix," he soliloquized;
"I've often heard of treeing bears, raccoons, and
other animals, but I never before heard of an
officer being treed in his own room, and on board
his own ship. I don't like to go out on deck,
and have those bullets whizzing by my head and
calling me 'cousin;' besides, I shall certainly be
shot, for there's that fellow in the gully, and I
know he's an excellent marksman. I've got to
stay here for awhile, that's evident. If I ever
get out, I'll make somebody sweat for this. I
wish I had my gun; but, as I am here unarmed,
I must find some kind of a protection." So saying,
he snatched the mattresses from the beds,
and, lying on the floor, placed one on each side
of him as a barricade. He remained in this position
until almost night, the bullets all the while
shrieking over the deck, and making music most
unpleasant to his ears. At length the firing
began to slacken, and Frank determined to make
another effort to get below. It was not a long
distance to the gangway that led to the main-deck,
but there was that fellow in the gully who still
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
maintained the fight, as an occasional crash in the
pantry proved, and Frank had a wholesome fear
of him. He resolved, however, to make the attempt,
and, waiting until the rebel had fired his
gun, he threw open the door, when a few hasty
steps carried him below. He heard a loud shout
as he ran, and knew that the rebel had seen him.</p>

<p>At dark the firing ceased altogether; and after
supper&mdash;the only cooked meal they had had during
the day&mdash;the officers assembled on deck to
enjoy the cool breeze, for the heat below had been
almost intolerable. It was late when they retired,
but it is needless to say that those who had rooms
on the quarter-deck slept in the mess-rooms.</p>

<p>The next morning, just as every one had expected,
the firing was again renewed by the rebels
in the battery, and it was at once answered by
some of the younger officers of the ship, who
cracked away, whether an enemy was in sight or
not. Frank had not been able to get the thought
of that rebel sharp-shooter out of his mind. The
audacity he had displayed in taking up a position
so close to the vessel, and the skill with which he
handled his rifle, excited his admiration, and he
determined that, should he again take up the same
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
position, he would renew his attempt to dislodge
him. He, however, took no part in the fight until
he came off watch at noon. He then provided
himself with a rifle, and, after considerable trouble,
succeeded in getting into the wheel-house, the
lower part of which, being built of thick timbers,
would easily resist a bullet, and here he settled
down, determined to fight his enemy as long as
he had a charge of powder left.</p>

<p>The rebel was in his old position, concealed
as usual, and, as the cabin ports had been closed,
he was directing his fire toward the pilot-house.
He was, of course, not aware that Frank had
changed his base of operations; but he did not
long remain ignorant of the fact, for the latter
commenced the fight without ceremony.</p>

<p>As nearly every officer on board the vessel
was engaged in fighting the rebels, the one in
question could not determine whence the shot
came. He drew back for a moment, and then
thrust his head carefully out, to reconnoiter.
Frank, who could fire seven shots without stopping
to reload, was ready for him, and another
bullet sped toward the mark, but, as usual, with
no more effect than throwing up a cloud of dust.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
This time, however, the rebel saw where it came
from, and a moment afterward a ball was buried
in the thick timbers, scarcely an inch from the
place where Frank was cautiously looking out,
watching the motions of his rival.</p>

<p>From his new position, Frank found that the
rebel, after he had fired his gun, was obliged to
turn over on his back to reload, and he determined
that, if he could not dislodge him, he would at
least put it out of his power to do any further
mischief. So, when the rebel exposed his arm,
as he was in the act of ramming down the charge,
he fired at him again. The latter, ignorant of the
fact that his opponent had a seven-shooter, now
redoubled his efforts, and made all haste to reload
his gun; but again did a bullet strike in the
bank close beside him, and cover him with a
shower of dust. This seemed to puzzle the rebel,
for he raised his head and gazed intently toward
the place where his enemy was concealed. That
move was fatal to him. Scarcely three inches of
his head was exposed; but the bullet went straight
to the mark&mdash;the rebel rolled down the bank, and
the deadly rifle fell from his hands.</p>

<h3>The Smugglers' Cave&mdash;Conclusion.</h3>

</div>
<p>om," said Frank, addressing himself
to the quarter-master, as the two
were standing their watch that
evening, "how came you to go to sea?"</p>

<p>"I was born a sailor, sir," answered
the man. "My father, and my grandfather
before him, followed the sea for
a livelihood. They were smugglers, living among
the rocks and crags on the southern coast of
England.</p>

<p>"My home was not such a one as would have
suited you, sir; but it was a pleasant place to me,
and I often look back to the days of my boyhood,
although passed amid scenes of danger, as
the happiest ones of my life. Our house, as we
called it, was a cave in the side of a high mountain,
at the foot of which was a long, narrow, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
rocky passage, that led to the ocean. At the
end of this passage, next to the mountain, was a
small but deep bay, where a vessel could ride at
anchor in safety without being seen by any one
outside. In front of the cave was a small grass
plot, which overlooked a vast extent of sea and
land, and from which the distant shores of France
could be seen. This was my post, where I sat
many a night, watching for the return of my
father, who was the captain of the smugglers. It
was my business to watch for revenue-cutters,
and to give the signal of danger in case any appeared
off the coast at the time father was expected
to return.</p>

<p>"It would have been a lonely watch in that
cave for one who was not accustomed to it, for I
never had a companion; but, having been brought
up to that kind of a life, I was never at a loss to
know how to pass away the time. The fishing in
the basin was excellent, and I had a small boat, the
exact model of my father's little schooner, with
which I sometimes amused myself for hours together
in running in and out of the channel, which,
owing to its rocky nature, was very difficult of
passage. It was here that the cutters were always
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
given the slip. Father never approached the
coast except during the night, and many a time
have I seen the swift little schooner come bounding
over the waves, with every stitch of her canvas
stretched, followed close in her wake by a
cutter. The latter would be certain of his prize
when he saw the schooner heading straight toward
the rocks; but, the first thing he knew, the smuggler
would be out of sight in the channel. No
light was necessary, for father knew every inch of
the ground, and before the man-o'-war could lower
his boats and discover the place where his prize
had so mysteriously disappeared, father would
have his goods landed, and, ere the cutter was
aware of it, he would run out of the channel under
his very nose, and make all sail for France. No
one outside of the band was ever known to enter
the channel; for, even in broad daylight, a person
would have declined making the trial, as the waves
dashed and roared among the rocks in a manner
that seemed to threaten destruction to any thing
that came within their reach.</p>

<p>"The schooner was several times overhauled
and boarded while at sea, but father never lost a
cargo. He always succeeded in fooling the revenue
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
chaps in some manner. I remember one time
in particular, when I made a trip on board the
schooner as mate. We made the run in our usual
time, easily eluding the cutters that were watching
us, and arrived off the coast of France with every
thing in order. One dark night we landed our
goods, and, after receiving our money, we ran
down to a little town, to purchase some necessary
articles, and to take in our return supply. A lot
of jabbering French policemen sprang on board
of us, almost before we had touched the wharf,
and commenced rummaging the hold; but they, of
course, went away disappointed in their hopes of
finding something to condemn us. We lay in port
alongside of a little Dutch trading vessel, that was
our exact model and build in every particular,
until night, when we received our goods, ran by
the police, and stood out to sea. We got along
nicely until just before daylight, when an 'Irish-man's
hurricane,' as we call a calm, set in, accompanied
by a heavy fog, and we lay motionless on
the water, with the sails flapping idly against the
masts. It was provoking, and a more uneasy
set of men than that schooner's crew I never saw.
We remained becalmed for nearly an hour, anxiously
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
waiting for the wind to spring up, when I
happened to step for'ard, and heard a noise like
the washing of the waves against the side of a
vessel. I hastily ran aft and reported the matter
to father, who silently stationed his men, and
walked for'ard, with his speaking-trumpet in his
hand, while we stood at our posts, almost fearing
to breathe, lest it should be heard on board of
the strange vessel, which was still concealed from
our view by the thick fog.</p>

<p>"At length, to our inexpressible relief, we felt
a puff of wind; then came another and another,
each one increasing in force, until the sails began
to draw, and the schooner commenced moving
slowly through the water. We stood off on the
starboard tack, intending to give our invisible
neighbor a wide berth; but he had also caught
the wind, and we could hear him moving along
almost in front of us. At length the fog lifted a
little, and we saw a large revenue-cutter standing
directly across our bows, scarcely a cable's length
distant. We luffed, to allow him to pass, when a
hail came from his deck:</p>

<p>"'Schooner ahoy!'</p>

<p>"'Yah,' shouted father through his trumpet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>"'What schooner is that?'</p>

<p>"'Dis? Dis is my schooner. You know it.'</p>

<p>"We all held our breath in suspense, wondering
what would be the result of this strange answer,
when we distinctly heard the voice say:</p>

<p>"'It's that rascally Dutchman again.' Then,
in a louder tone, came the question, 'Did you
keep a good look-out for that smuggler, as we
requested?'</p>

<p>"'Yah! But I haven't saw him.'</p>

<p>"'O, shiver your ugly figure-head,' was the
answer. 'I've a good notion to put a six-pound
shot into you, you wooden-headed sour-krout
eater. This makes twice that we have been fooled
by you. Now off you go, and don't you cross
our hawse again.'</p>

<p>"Father made no reply, and the cutter put her
helm down, and started off. We passed under
her stern, and in a few moments she disappeared
in the fog. The next night we entered the channel,
and landed our goods in safety. We afterward
learned that the cutter, which had been
closely watching our movements, had boarded the
Dutch schooner, (which I have before mentioned,
and which sailed about two hours in advance of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
us,) and so certain were they that they had at
last gobbled the smuggler, that they seized the
vessel, and unceremoniously slapped the captain
and his crew in double irons. The skipper was
so terrified that he forgot his English, and jabbered
away in Dutch; and it was not until the
ship's papers had been overhauled, that the cutter
discovered her mistake. When the revenue fellows
ran foul of us, they were again deceived by
the resemblance between the two vessels, and the
manner in which father had imitated the Dutch
skipper's language. About a year after that we
had a stopper put on our operations, by one of
our own men.</p>

<p>"The cave had two entrances&mdash;one by a rope
ladder from the basin below, which we could draw
up in times of danger, and the other by a path
through the mountains, which was known only to
a few of the band whom father thought he could
trust. But his confidence was abused. There is
a black sheep in every flock, and we had one
among us&mdash;a man who, tempted by the offer of
reward that was held out for our apprehension,
betrayed us, and broke up our harboring-place.</p>

<p>"It was this man's business to go to Bath, a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
small town about two miles from the cave, to dispose
of our goods to the merchants in that place,
and receive the funds. Young as I was, I almost
knew that the fellow would one day get us into
trouble. He was a short, powerfully-built man,
with a most villainous countenance. He was always
silent and morose; could not bear to have you
look him in the eye; in short, he was just the
man that I would have picked out from among a
hundred as a traitor. Father seemed to repose
entire confidence in him, and always asked his advice
in times of danger; but, as much as I respected
his judgment, I could not conquer the feeling with
which I had always regarded the man, and I was
constantly on the watch.</p>

<p>"One night the schooner sailed as usual, but
this man, under pretense of sickness, remained
behind, with instructions from father, in case he
got better, to go to the village and collect some
money due him for goods.</p>

<p>"'All right,' answered the mate; 'I'll attend
to it.' Then, as soon as father had got out of
hearing, he muttered, 'I'll collect something for
you that you won't expect.'</p>

<p>"As soon as the schooner had cleared the channel,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
and was fairly out to sea, the rapidity with
which that man got well was astonishing. He
staid about the cave all day, scarcely saying a
word to me, and at night departed by the secret
path for the village. I was very uneasy, for a
dread of impending evil constantly pressed upon
me, and I determined to watch the path, and be
ready for any emergency.</p>

<p>"On the cliff, at the entrance of the channel
that led to the bay, was a pile of dry wood, that
was to be lighted in case of danger. This I replenished,
placing materials for striking a light
close at hand, and then returned to the cave to
keep watch of the path.</p>

<p>"Two days passed without the occurrence of
any thing unusual, and the night came on which
the schooner was expected to return. I divided
my attention between the secret path and the
offing, and at length a blue light, moving up and
down in the darkness, told me that the schooner
was approaching. I answered the signal, and
stood peering through the darkness to get a
glimpse of the approaching vessel, when I heard
a rustling behind me, and looking down the path
I discovered, to my dismay, a party of armed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
men approaching, headed by the traitor, who said,
in a low voice:</p>

<p>"'It's all right now. Catch that brat before
he has time to light the signal of danger, and let
the schooner once get into the channel, and we
have got them fast.'</p>

<p>"The person spoken of as 'that brat' was myself,
and I knew that the salvation of the schooner
depended upon my exertions. In an instant I
had determined upon my course, and, springing
from the cave, I ran toward the rope ladder that
led to the basin below, and commenced descending.
A moment afterward the mouth of the cave was
filled by the burly form of the traitor, who exclaimed:</p>

<p>"'There he is&mdash;shoot him!' and, suiting the
action to the word, he leveled his pistol and fired.
I felt a sharp pain shoot through my shoulder; a
faintness seized upon me, and, being unable longer
to retain my hold upon the ladder, I disappeared
in the basin. My sudden immersion in the cold
water revived me, and, being an excellent swimmer,
I struck out, intending to climb the cliff on
the opposite side, and fire the pile. I exerted
myself to the utmost, for I could see by the lights
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
in the mouth of the cave that the traitor and his
men were preparing to follow me; but, it seemed,
in my hurry and excitement, that I scarcely moved
through the water. At length, however, I reached
the opposite shore, and after climbing the cliff,
(which I did with the utmost difficulty, for my
wounded arm was hanging almost useless at my
side, and I had not stopped to look for the path,)
I ran at the top of my speed toward the pile.
The schooner having seen my signal, and supposing,
of course, that all was right, was still standing
toward the mouth of the channel. A moment
more, and I would have been too late.</p>

<p>"I had considerable difficulty in finding my
flint, and then it seemed impossible to strike a
light; but, just as the foremost of my pursuers
reached the top of the cliff, I succeeded in catching
a spark; in a moment more, the whole pile was
in a blaze. I could not refrain from giving a shout
of triumph as I saw the flames shooting upward
toward the sky, lighting up the whole face of the
rocks, until every object was as clearly defined as
in broad daylight. I heard an exclamation of surprise
on board the schooner, followed by a few
hastily-spoken orders; then I knew that I had succeeded,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
and the schooner was safe. But I was not
a moment too soon, for the little vessel was rapidly
nearing the mouth of the channel, and once enclosed
by those rocky walls, once under the influence
of those waves that dashed so madly over the
rocks, retreat would have been impossible.</p>

<p>"I was allowed scarcely a moment to congratulate
myself upon my success, for my pursuers,
finding themselves foiled, determined to wreak
their vengeance upon me. They could plainly
see me by the light of the burning pile, and the
quick discharge of half a dozen pistols sent the
bullets thickly around me. It was death to remain
where I was, so, taking a last look at the
cave, I threw myself over the cliff, and struck out
for the schooner.</p>

<p>"My father, having seen me when I took the
leap, laid the schooner to, and lowered a boat to
pick me up. I tell you, sir, I was a proud youngster
when I stood on that deck, receiving the
thanks and the congratulations of those I had
saved. I forgot the pain of my wound, and the
dangers from which I had escaped, in the joy I
experienced at finding myself once more safe
among my friends."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>Their watch ending with Tom's interesting reminiscence,
they then turned in for the night.</p>

<p>The next morning the attack upon the bluffs
was renewed, without resulting to the advantage
of either side, and at night the vessels again withdrew,
and retreated down the river. The Trenton
returned to her old landing, and Frank, at his request,
was again placed in command of one of the
guns of the battery. But he was not destined to
hold the position long, for, now that the "beauties"
had dismounted that troublesome gun, General
Sherman had advanced his works until he
could go no further without getting into the enemy's
line. At length, one morning, a flag of truce
was raised within their fortifications, and hostilities
were at once suspended. Then came that celebrated
interview between the generals, during
which the soldiers on both sides clambered out
of the rifle-pits, and conversed face to face with
the men with whom they had so long been engaged
in deadly conflict.</p>

<p>"How are you now, Johnny?" inquired Frank,
seating himself on one of the guns, and waving his
hat to a rebel officer who stood in the rifle-pits,
gazing at the battery with great interest. "What
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
does that flag of truce mean? Are you going to
surrender?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," replied the rebel; "but, I say,
Yank, will you let a fellow come over there?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Come on."</p>

<p>The rebel accordingly laid aside his weapons,
and walked over to the battery, where, after examining
the guns very curiously, he entered into
conversation with Frank, in the course of which
he informed him that they were a "played-out
concern," and could not possibly hold out more
than a week longer.</p>

<p>But they did not "hold out" so long; for, on
the next day, the fourth of July, the victorious
army entered the city, and raised the <span class="smcap">Stars and
Stripes</span> over the "<span class="smcap">Sebastopol of the Rebels</span>."</p>

<p>Here we leave our hero, reposing before Vicksburg
on his well-earned reputation as a gallant
young officer, waiting to be ordered to new scenes
of excitement and danger further down the Mississippi
and up her tributary streams. Through
these scenes we shall conduct our readers in a
concluding volume, which will close Frank's career
on our Western waters.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:0.8em;"><span class="smcap">Mr. Brannan</span> is well known, to the people of the West especially,
as an artist, and an occasional contributor of poetry to the Press. His
"<span class="smcap">Harp of a Thousand Strings</span>," a burlesque sermon, has been long
recognized as the best of its class. The present volume is one of
superior merit for the wit and humor of the Autobiography, the pathos,
imagination and smooth versification of the Occasional Pieces scattered
in profusion throughout. This work is destined to place Mr.
<span class="smcap">Brannan</span> high in the rank of American Poets, and to give him position
as a leader among the Bards of the West.</span></p>
